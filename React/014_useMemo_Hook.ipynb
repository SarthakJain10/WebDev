    "# React `useMemo` Hook \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "- This lecture explains the **React `useMemo` hook**, when to use it, and how it helps in **performance optimization** by avoiding unnecessary expensive calculations. \n",
    "- The instructor first builds intuition with the concept of **memoization**, then demonstrates `useMemo` using a React counter app with an artificially expensive calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## React Hooks and the `use` Prefix  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In React, hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useForm`, `useNavigate`, and `useDispatch` follow a common naming convention: hook names start with the **`use` prefix**. \n",
    "- `useMemo` follows the same convention, indicating that it is also a React hook that plugs into React’s rendering lifecycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memoization – Core Idea  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Memoization?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memoization** is a technique where the result of a computation is **stored** so that when the same input appears again, the stored answer is reused instead of recomputing. \n",
    "- It is widely used in **dynamic programming (DP)** and recursive solutions in DSA to avoid solving the same subproblem multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive Example (Student–Teacher)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A teacher asks a student:  \n",
    "  - What is \\(2 \\times 3\\)? The student computes 6 once and stores/remembers it. \n",
    "  - Later, when \\(2 \\times 3\\) is asked again, the student returns 6 directly without recalculation. \n",
    "- For new questions like \\(4 \\times 3\\) or \\(6 \\times 6\\), the student computes once, stores the result, and then reuses it if asked again. \n",
    "- Key idea:  \n",
    "  - If a problem has **not** been solved before: compute and store the result.  \n",
    "  - If it **has** been solved before: **do not compute again**; just return the stored result. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Memoization is Useful  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Recomputing the same result repeatedly wastes **time** and **resources**, especially for heavy tasks like large loops, complex calculations, or expensive API/data operations. \n",
    "- Memoization ensures that **already-solved problems are not solved again**, which improves performance in both algorithms (DP) and UI frameworks like React. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expensive Operations in React  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an “Expensive” Operation?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- An **expensive operation** is any task that consumes **a lot of time**, **memory**, or **system resources**. \n",
    "- Examples in a React app:  \n",
    "  - Heavy loops over large ranges.  \n",
    "  - Complex mathematical computations.  \n",
    "  - Costly data transformations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Artificial Expensive Task Example  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The instructor defines an `expensiveTask` function that:  \n",
    "  - Takes a number as input and returns its double. \n",
    "  - To make it expensive, a loop runs from 0 to a very large number (e.g., up to 100 crore) before returning the result. \n",
    "- Although doubling itself is simple, the big loop makes the function **slow** on each call. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## React Counter App Setup  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Counter Component  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The instructor creates a simple React app (using Vite) with:  \n",
    "  - A **state variable** `count` and `setCount` managed by `useState`. \n",
    "  - A button that increments `count` on each click. \n",
    "- Initially, the app runs fast because there are no heavy computations inside the component. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the Expensive Task  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable `doubleValue` is introduced:  \n",
    "  - `let doubleValue = expensiveTask(4);` (first version: hardcoded `4`). \n",
    "  - `doubleValue` is rendered in JSX to display the doubled value. \n",
    "- After this change, clicking the increment button becomes **noticeably slow**, because `expensiveTask` runs on every render. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## How React Re-Rendering Causes Slowness  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Render Flow Explanation  \n",
    "\n",
    "- On button click:  \n",
    "  - `setCount(count + 1)` is called, which updates the `count` state. \n",
    "  - Any state update triggers a **re-render** of the component. \n",
    "- On each render, **the entire component function runs again**, including:  \n",
    "  - The line where `expensiveTask` is called.  \n",
    "  - The heavy loop inside `expensiveTask`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Observed Behavior  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Every click on the counter button triggers the expensive loop again, even though the input (like `4`) and thus the result are exactly the same. \n",
    "- This repeated unnecessary execution causes the UI to lag and respond slowly to user actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement in React Terms  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **core problem**: an **expensive calculation is being recalculated on every render** even when its input has not changed. \n",
    "- In the example, `expensiveTask` always receives the same value (e.g., `4`), so recomputing the result on every render is wasteful. \n",
    "- Desired behavior:  \n",
    "  - Compute once for a given input.  \n",
    "  - Reuse the same result until the input changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to `useMemo`  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What `useMemo` Does  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `useMemo` is a React hook used to **memoize** the result of a function so that the function is **only re-run when its dependencies change**. \n",
    "- In simpler words:  \n",
    "  - If the input (dependency) is the same as the last render, `useMemo` returns the **cached value** without calling the function again.  \n",
    "  - If the input changes, `useMemo` calls the function, stores the new result, and returns it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Signature  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Conceptually, `useMemo` looks like:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  ```jsx\n",
    "  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {\n",
    "    // some calculation using dependencies\n",
    "    return computeSomething(deps);\n",
    "  }, [deps]);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters:  \n",
    "  - First argument: a **function** that returns the computed value (the “expensive” calculation). \n",
    "  - Second argument: a **dependency array** that tells React when to recompute. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying `useMemo` to the Example  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Input State  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of always doubling 4, the instructor adds an **input field** so the user can type a number: \n",
    "  - New state: `const [input, setInput] = useState(0);`  \n",
    "  - The input field is bound to this state using `value={input}` and `onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}`. \n",
    "- The expensive calculation is then changed to use `input` instead of a hardcoded number:  \n",
    "  - `doubleValue = expensiveTask(input);` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue Without `useMemo`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Even after tying the double calculation to `input`, the problem remains:  \n",
    "  - Clicking the **counter** button (which does not affect `input`) still causes `expensiveTask(input)` to run on every render. \n",
    "- Result: the counter continues to lag, because the expensive function is re-run even when `input` has not changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrapping with `useMemo`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The expression is updated to use `useMemo`:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  ```jsx\n",
    "  const doubleValue = useMemo(() => {\n",
    "    return expensiveTask(input);\n",
    "  }, [input]);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpretation:  \n",
    "  - The function passed to `useMemo` computes `expensiveTask(input)`.  \n",
    "  - The dependency array `[input]` tells React:  \n",
    "    - Only recompute `doubleValue` when `input` changes.  \n",
    "    - If `input` stays the same across renders, reuse the previously stored result. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behavior After Using `useMemo`  \n",
    "\n",
    "### When `input` Does Not Change  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Clicking the counter button updates `count`, causing a re-render, but `input` remains the same. \n",
    "- Because the dependency `[input]` has not changed:  \n",
    "  - `useMemo` does **not** re-run `expensiveTask`.  \n",
    "  - It returns the **memoized value** from the previous render. \n",
    "- Effect:  \n",
    "  - The counter increments smoothly.  \n",
    "  - UI is responsive, and lag from the expensive loop is removed when it is unnecessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When `input` Changes  \n",
    "\n",
    "- When the user types a new number in the input field:  \n",
    "  - `setInput` is called, updating `input` and triggering a re-render. \n",
    "  - Because `input` in the dependency array has changed, `useMemo` calls `expensiveTask(input)` again to compute the new double. \n",
    "- This recalculation is **necessary**, as the output genuinely depends on the new input. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Details and Clarifications  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Only Last Value Is Cached  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this `useMemo` example, React **does not maintain a map for all past inputs**. \n",
    "- `useMemo` stores only the **last computed value** associated with the last dependency snapshot. \n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - If you compute for input 3, then for 4, then for 5:  \n",
    "    - The memoized value corresponds only to the latest input (5).  \n",
    "    - If you go back to 3 or 4, the function will compute again. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `useMemo` vs Algorithmic Memoization  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In algorithmic memoization (like DP), you often store results for many subproblems in a table or dictionary. \n",
    "- In React `useMemo`, you get **one memoized value per hook usage**, tied to the **last dependency values**, not a full history cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When `useMemo` Does Not Help  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Changing `input` will always require recomputing the double, because the desired result genuinely depends on it. \n",
    "- `useMemo` is not about avoiding **necessary** work; it is about avoiding **unnecessary repetition** when dependencies do not change. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use `useMemo`  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Use Cases  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `useMemo` when:  \n",
    "  - You have a **heavy computation** inside a component that runs on every render. \n",
    "  - The result of that computation depends on values that often **do not change** across renders. \n",
    "  - Recomputing it is visibly slowing down the UI or wasting resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Avoid Overuse  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Do **not** use `useMemo` everywhere:  \n",
    "  - Wrapping trivial or cheap calculations in `useMemo` adds complexity without real benefit. \n",
    "  - Overusing it can make code harder to read and maintain. \n",
    "- A good heuristic:  \n",
    "  - If you feel “this function is expensive and is being called unnecessarily when inputs haven’t changed”, then `useMemo` is appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference: Typical `useMemo` Pattern  \n",
    "\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "import { useState, useMemo } from \"react\";\n",
    "\n",
    "function Example() {\n",
    "  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "  const [input, setInput] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "  function expensiveTask(num) {\n",
    "    // Heavy loop (dummy) to simulate expensive work\n",
    "    for (let i = 0; i <= 1_000_000_000; i++) {}\n",
    "    return num * 2;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  const doubleValue = useMemo(() => {\n",
    "    return expensiveTask(input);\n",
    "  }, [input]);\n",
    "\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <>\n",
    "      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "      <div>Count: {count}</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "      <input\n",
    "        type=\"number\"\n",
    "        value={input}\n",
    "        onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}\n",
    "        placeholder=\"Enter number\"\n",
    "      />\n",
    "      <div>Double: {doubleValue}</div>\n",
    "    </>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- This pattern mirrors the lecture’s example: an expensive calculation is memoized and only recomputed when `input` changes, not when unrelated state (`count`) updates. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary – Main Takeaways  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memoization** means storing computed results so they can be reused later for the same inputs instead of recomputing. \n",
    "- React’s **`useMemo` hook** memoizes the result of a function and recomputes it only when specified dependencies change, helping avoid unnecessary expensive work on re-renders. \n",
    "- In the lecture example, an artificially expensive `expensiveTask` made the counter lag, and wrapping it in `useMemo` with `[input]` eliminated useless recalculations when only `count` changed. \n",
    "- Use `useMemo` **selectively** wherever there are **unnecessary repeated expensive calculations**, but avoid overusing it for simple or cheap operations. \n"
