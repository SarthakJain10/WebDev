    "# React Components, Props, and JSX\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture explains three core React concepts: components, props, and JSX syntax, using a simple card-based UI example. \n",
    "The instructor starts from a basic React setup and gradually builds a small app that displays multiple user cards with different names, images, descriptions, and styles. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## React Project Setup (Quick Context) \n",
    "\n",
    "- A new React project is created using the recommended command from the React “Get Started” page (e.g., via terminal, choosing JavaScript template). \n",
    "- After creation:\n",
    "  - `cd` into the project folder.\n",
    "  - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.\n",
    "  - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and open the project link in the browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Cleanup and Global Styles \n",
    "\n",
    "- Default template code in `App.jsx` (or similar) is removed to start with a clean UI. \n",
    "- A simple `h1` with text like “Hello ji” is rendered as the initial UI. \n",
    "- Global CSS reset and layout:\n",
    "  - `margin: 0`, `padding: 0`, `box-sizing: border-box`.\n",
    "  - Set a font-family (e.g., Times New Roman).\n",
    "  - Make `body` take full viewport height and center content using flexbox (`display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, `align-items: center`). \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## React Components \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is a Component? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Informal idea: In React, **a component can be thought of as a function that returns some UI code that looks like HTML**. \n",
    "- A component represents a **section of the UI**, like:\n",
    "  - Navbar\n",
    "  - Footer\n",
    "  - Sidebar\n",
    "  - Main content area  \n",
    "  Each of these can be written as separate components and reused. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function vs Class Components \n",
    "\n",
    "- Earlier:\n",
    "  - Class components handled state and lifecycle methods; functional components were simpler and lacked hooks. \n",
    "- After React updates:\n",
    "  - Functional components got hooks and state management features.\n",
    "  - Most modern code uses **function-based (functional) components**.\n",
    "  - You may still see class components in older codebases (e.g., legacy apps), but new code is typically functional. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Custom Component (UserCard) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Folder and File Structure \n",
    "\n",
    "- A `components` folder is created to follow good structure practices. \n",
    "- Inside it:\n",
    "  - `UserCard.jsx` – React component.\n",
    "  - `UserCard.css` – Styles for this component. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Component Definition \n",
    "\n",
    "- A React component is implemented as a function (often arrow function) that returns JSX:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In `UserCard.jsx`, an arrow function is assigned to a variable (e.g., `const UserCard = () => { ... }`). \n",
    "  - The function returns JSX with structure like:\n",
    "    - A root `div` with a class (e.g., `user-container`).\n",
    "    - A paragraph to show the user name.\n",
    "    - An `img` tag for the user’s photo.\n",
    "    - Another paragraph for user description. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exporting the component**:\n",
    "  - The component must be exported (e.g., `export default UserCard;`) so it can be imported and used in other files like `App.jsx`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Rule: Single Root Element \n",
    "\n",
    "- Every component must return **exactly one root parent element**. \n",
    "- You cannot have multiple top-level siblings like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Wrong (conceptually):  \n",
    "    `return (<div>...</div><div>...</div>);`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Correct: Wrap children inside a single parent:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `return (<div> ... all child elements ... </div>);`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- This applies to all components (like `App` and `UserCard`). \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the Component in App \n",
    "\n",
    "### Import and Use in App Component \n",
    "\n",
    "- In `App.jsx`:\n",
    "  - Import: `import UserCard from \"./components/UserCard\";` (path as per project structure). \n",
    "  - Use it like an HTML tag:\n",
    "    - `<UserCard />`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- To show multiple cards:\n",
    "  - Write `<UserCard />` multiple times inside the `App` component’s JSX. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Linking CSS to the Component \n",
    "\n",
    "- `UserCard.css` is linked inside `UserCard.jsx` via an import, e.g., `import \"./UserCard.css\";`. \n",
    "- Without this import, styles defined in `UserCard.css` will not apply, which was seen when the card styles didn’t reflect until the CSS file was imported. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSX Essentials \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is JSX? \n",
    "\n",
    "- JSX = **JavaScript XML** (often described informally as “HTML-like code inside JavaScript”). \n",
    "- JSX looks like HTML but:\n",
    "  - Is written inside JavaScript files.\n",
    "  - Allows usage of JavaScript expressions directly in the markup via `{}`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example ideas from the lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `{props.name}` inside JSX to print a dynamic value instead of hard-coding text. \n",
    "- Using `{props.image}` to set the `src` attribute of an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX vs HTML Differences (Key Points) \n",
    "\n",
    "- **class vs className**:\n",
    "  - In JSX, `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, so for CSS classes you must use `className`. \n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    - HTML: `<div class=\"user-container\">`\n",
    "    - JSX: `<div className=\"user-container\">` \n",
    "\n",
    "- JSX can include **JavaScript expressions**:\n",
    "  - Everything inside `{}` is treated as JavaScript. \n",
    "  - Used for dynamic values (props, variables, expressions).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concept: Think of JSX as HTML-like code with added JavaScript power; it is ultimately transformed into JavaScript under the hood. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Styling the UserCard Component \n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial CSS for Layout \n",
    "\n",
    "In `UserCard.css`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the card container (class like `.user-container`):\n",
    "  - Background color set using a picked color (e.g., from a website like `htmlcolorcodes`). \n",
    "  - Padding (e.g., `20px` or `25px`) to give spacing inside the card.\n",
    "  - Flexbox-related properties to control layout:\n",
    "    - `display: flex`\n",
    "    - `flex-direction: column`\n",
    "    - `justify-content: center`\n",
    "    - `align-items: center`\n",
    "    - `gap: 1.5rem` (space between elements). \n",
    "\n",
    "- For the wrapper container (e.g., `.container` used in `App.jsx`):\n",
    "  - `display: flex`\n",
    "  - `flex-wrap: wrap`\n",
    "  - `gap: 20px`\n",
    "  - `margin` for spacing around the cards. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Styling the Image \n",
    "\n",
    "- The image is selected via an id like `#user-image` or via a class. \n",
    "- Styles:\n",
    "  - Set fixed `height: 100px` and `width: 100px` to make all user images uniform. \n",
    "  - For circular images, use `border-radius: 50%`. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing and Using Images in React \n",
    "\n",
    "### Placing Images and Importing Them \n",
    "\n",
    "- Images are placed inside an `assets` folder (e.g., under `src/assets`). \n",
    "- To use an image in JSX:\n",
    "  - Import it in the component file:\n",
    "    - `import lovePic from \"../assets/love-pic.jpg\";`\n",
    "    - Similar imports for other images (e.g., Maharana, Prithviraj). \n",
    "  - Use it as:\n",
    "    - `<img src={lovePic} alt=\"User\" />` inside JSX. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistake and Fix \n",
    "\n",
    "- Trying to pass image paths as plain strings without proper JS expression syntax or import can fail. \n",
    "- Correct approach:\n",
    "  - Import the image file into a variable.\n",
    "  - Pass that variable as a prop or use it directly in `src` with `{}`. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Props: Passing Data Between Components \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Props? \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Props** (properties) are used to pass data from one component to another, typically from parent to child. \n",
    "- Conceptually:\n",
    "  - Component A (parent) → sends data → Component B (child).\n",
    "  - That data is called “props.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of props in the lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`\n",
    "- `description`\n",
    "- `image`\n",
    "- `style` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending Props from Parent (App) \n",
    "\n",
    "In `App.jsx`, while using `UserCard`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pass props as attributes on the JSX tag, similar to HTML attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For different names:\n",
    "    - `<UserCard name=\"Love Rana\" />`\n",
    "    - `<UserCard name=\"Maharana Pratap\" />`\n",
    "    - `<UserCard name=\"Prithviraj Chauhan\" />` \n",
    "\n",
    "  - For descriptions:\n",
    "    - `<UserCard description=\"Description One\" />`\n",
    "    - `<UserCard description=\"Description Two\" />`\n",
    "    - `<UserCard description=\"Description Three\" />` \n",
    "\n",
    "  - For images:\n",
    "    - After importing images in `App.jsx`:\n",
    "      - `import lovePic from \"./assets/love-pic.jpg\";`\n",
    "      - `import maharana from \"./assets/maharana.jpg\";`\n",
    "      - `import prithviraj from \"./assets/prithviraj.jpg\";` \n",
    "    - Pass them:\n",
    "      - `<UserCard image={lovePic} ... />`\n",
    "      - `<UserCard image={maharana} ... />`\n",
    "      - `<UserCard image={prithviraj} ... />` \n",
    "\n",
    "  - For style:\n",
    "    - `<UserCard style={{ borderRadius: \"10px\" }} />` passed as a prop. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiving Props in Child (UserCard) \n",
    "\n",
    "- In `UserCard.jsx`, function signature includes `props`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `const UserCard = (props) => { ... }` \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use props inside JSX via curly braces:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Replace static name text:\n",
    "    - From: `\"Love Babbar\"`\n",
    "    - To: `{props.name}` \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Replace static description:\n",
    "    - `{props.description}` \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use image prop:\n",
    "    - `<img src={props.image} alt={props.name} />` \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Apply style prop:\n",
    "    - `<div className=\"user-container\" style={props.style}> ... </div>` \n",
    "\n",
    "- Key rule: **Always use curly braces `{}` to access props in JSX**, because this is JavaScript syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How Props Change the UI \n",
    "\n",
    "- First card:\n",
    "  - `name=\"Love Rana\"`, `description=\"Description One\"`, `image={lovePic}` → Shows Love Rana with its specific description and image. \n",
    "- Second card:\n",
    "  - `name=\"Maharana Pratap\"` etc. → Shows Maharana Pratap with correct description and image. \n",
    "- Third card:\n",
    "  - `name=\"Prithviraj Chauhan\"` etc. → Shows that data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how a **single component definition** can render multiple different UIs just by changing the props. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Passing Style via Props \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending Inline Style Object \n",
    "\n",
    "- In `App.jsx`, a style object is passed:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    - `<UserCard style={{ borderRadius: \"10px\" }} ... />` \n",
    "\n",
    "- Note:\n",
    "  - Outer `{}` = JSX expression.\n",
    "  - Inner `{}` = JavaScript object literal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying the Style in the Component \n",
    "\n",
    "- In `UserCard.jsx`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `<div className=\"user-container\" style={props.style}> ... </div>` \n",
    "\n",
    "- Effect:\n",
    "  - The `border-radius: 10px` style is applied to that card container.\n",
    "  - Same style can be reused for all cards or adjusted per card. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting It All Together: What the App Does \n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple React app is built that:  \n",
    "  - Has a main `App` component rendering a `container` div. \n",
    "  - Inside the container, three `UserCard` components are rendered.\n",
    "  - Each `UserCard` receives different `name`, `description`, and `image` via props.\n",
    "  - All cards share common layout and style, with rounded corners and aligned content. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Key behaviors:\n",
    "  - **Reusability**: Same `UserCard` component reused three times with different data. \n",
    "  - **Separation of concerns**: UI structure in components, styles in CSS (plus inline style via props where needed), data passed via props. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Terms and Ideas \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Component**: A function (or class) that returns JSX representing a section of UI, reusable across the app. \n",
    "- **Functional Component**: Component written as a function; now the standard approach in modern React (with hooks for state and side effects). \n",
    "- **Props**: Inputs to a component, passed from parent to child like attributes, used to customize the rendered output. \n",
    "- **JSX**: Syntax that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript and embed JavaScript expressions using `{}`. \n",
    "- **Single Root Element**: Every React component must return exactly one parent element. \n",
    "- **className**: JSX attribute used instead of `class` to assign CSS classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Main Takeaways \n",
    "\n",
    "- Components are the building blocks of a React UI; think of them as functions that return JSX for a particular UI section. \n",
    "- Modern React prefers functional components, which now support hooks and state, over older class components. \n",
    "- Props are used to pass data (text, images, styles, etc.) from parent components to child components, allowing the same component to render different content. \n",
    "- JSX is HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript that supports JavaScript expressions through `{}`, and has specific differences like using `className` instead of `class`. \n",
    "- The lecture’s example app demonstrates how to create a `UserCard` component, link its CSS, import and use images, pass props (name, description, image, style), and render multiple customized cards from a single component definition."
