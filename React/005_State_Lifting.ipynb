    "# Lifting State Up in React \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture explains the concept of **lifting state up** in React, an important pattern for interviews and real-world applications where multiple components need to share and synchronize the same state. \n",
    "It builds on prior knowledge of **components**, **props**, and the **useState hook**, and shows how data can effectively flow from child to parent and between sibling components. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Props and Component Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Props are the mechanism by which a **parent component passes data to its child components** in React. \n",
    "In a component tree, data via props naturally flows **one way: from parent to child**, not directly from child to parent or between siblings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A component tree can be visualized as:\n",
    "  - One parent component\n",
    "  - Multiple child components\n",
    "  - Sibling components sharing the same parent \n",
    "- Data transfer with props:\n",
    "  - Parent → Child A (via props)\n",
    "  - Parent → Child B (via props)\n",
    "  - No direct Child A → Child B prop passing \n",
    "\n",
    "Important term:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Props**: Read-only data passed from a parent to a child component, used by the child for rendering. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Need for Lifting State Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main scenarios create the need for lifting state up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Child to Parent Communication**  \n",
    "   - Requirement: Data is generated or changed in a child component but must be **known or used by the parent**. \n",
    "   - Example: A child input component updates a value that the parent must display or process. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sharing State Between Siblings**  \n",
    "   - Scenario:  \n",
    "     - Child A creates/maintains some state.  \n",
    "     - Child B also needs access to the **same state**, and both should remain **in sync**. \n",
    "   - Direct transfer from Child A to Child B is not possible via props because props only go from parent to child. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:  \n",
    "To synchronize state between multiple components (especially siblings) or to reflect child-originated changes at the parent level, the state must be **moved (lifted) from the child component to their common parent**. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea of Lifting State Up\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Lifting state up means **moving a piece of state and its update logic from a lower-level component (child) to a higher-level common ancestor (parent)** so that multiple components can share and stay synchronized with that state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Core principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **parent**:\n",
    "  - Creates the state using `useState`. \n",
    "  - Manages and changes the state. \n",
    "  - Passes:\n",
    "    - The state value itself.\n",
    "    - The state updater function (setter) to children via props. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **children**:\n",
    "  - Receive the state value and setter function via props. \n",
    "  - Use the state value for display.\n",
    "  - Call the setter function to request changes to the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any change triggered from **any child** updates the **single source of truth** in the parent.  \n",
    "- All children receiving that state get the **updated value**, ensuring perfect synchronization. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Parent-to-Child Props Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before lifting state, the lecture revisits the basic pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `App` component (parent) uses a `Card` component (child). \n",
    "- Parent passes a value via props:\n",
    "  - Example: `<Card name=\"Love Babbar\" />`. \n",
    "- Child reads props:\n",
    "  - Example: displays `props.name` in JSX. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is **simple one-way data flow**: parent → child. \n",
    "- No state lifting is involved yet; this is the normal props usage pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting Child State to Parent State\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original (Not Lifted) Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Child component maintains its own state:\n",
    "  - Example: `Card` has `const [name, setName] = useState(\"\")` inside it. \n",
    "  - Child’s input field updates `name` locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parent has **no access** to this `name` state.\n",
    "- Sibling components **cannot share** this state.\n",
    "- State is **isolated** inside one child component. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lifting the State to the Parent\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable sharing and parent awareness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Move state to the parent**  \n",
    "   - In `App` (parent):\n",
    "     - `const [name, setName] = useState(\"\");`. \n",
    "   - The parent now owns the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pass state and setter to children via props**  \n",
    "   - Example:  \n",
    "     - `<Card name={name} setName={setName} />`. \n",
    "   - Every child that should share the state receives **both**:\n",
    "     - `name` (state value)\n",
    "     - `setName` (state updater function) \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Child uses props instead of local state**  \n",
    "   - Child uses:\n",
    "     - `props.name` to display the value. \n",
    "     - `props.setName` to update it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "- State is centralized in the parent.\n",
    "- Child is now **controlled** by parent’s state.\n",
    "- Multiple components can share and reflect this same state. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Child-to-Parent Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Once state is in the parent, child still appears to “update” it by calling the setter function passed down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical pattern inside Child:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input field:\n",
    "  - `<input type=\"text\" onChange={handleChange} />`. \n",
    "- Handler:\n",
    "  - `function handleChange(e) { props.setName(e.target.value); }`. \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User types in the child’s input.\n",
    "- `onChange` triggers with event `e`.\n",
    "- Child calls `props.setName(e.target.value)`.\n",
    "- Parent’s `name` state updates.\n",
    "- All components receiving `name` via props get the new value and re-render. \n",
    "\n",
    "Verification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Child component prints: `Name state variable inside Card: {props.name}`. \n",
    "- Parent component prints: `I am inside parent component and value of name is {name}`. \n",
    "- Typing in the child input updates both parent and child displays simultaneously, confirming lifting is working. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Synchronizing Sibling Components with Lifting State\n",
    "\n",
    "Once state is in the parent, adding more synchronized children is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Two Card Components\n",
    "\n",
    "In parent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `const [name, setName] = useState(\"\");`. \n",
    "- Two children:\n",
    "  - `<Card title=\"Card One\" name={name} setName={setName} />`  \n",
    "  - `<Card title=\"Card Two\" name={name} setName={setName} />`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In child (`Card`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reads and displays:\n",
    "  - `props.title`. \n",
    "  - `props.name`. \n",
    "- Uses `props.setName` in the input change handler. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typing into input (even in one card):\n",
    "  - Updates parent’s `name`.\n",
    "  - Reflects updated `name` in **both Card One and Card Two**. \n",
    "- All sibling components that receive the same state mirror the same value, staying perfectly synchronized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaway:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Any number of children** can share the same state by receiving the same parent-owned state and setter via props. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Summary of Lifting State\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parent component\n",
    "  - Children: Child A, Child B, Child C, etc. \n",
    "- Originally:\n",
    "  - Child A has its own `stateA`.\n",
    "  - Child B has its own `stateB`.\n",
    "  - They are independent and cannot stay in sync easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "With lifting state:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Move shared state to parent:\n",
    "  - Parent defines a single `stateShared` and its setter. \n",
    "- Parent passes `stateShared` and setter to:\n",
    "  - Child A via props.\n",
    "  - Child B via props.\n",
    "  - Other children if needed. \n",
    "- Child A and Child B now both:\n",
    "  - Use `stateShared` for rendering.\n",
    "  - Use the same setter function to update it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All children now depend on **one centralized state**.\n",
    "- They behave in a synchronized, predictable way.\n",
    "- Adding more children that share the same state is easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Use Cases from React Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture references official React documentation examples that demonstrate lifting state up in real UIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Mutually Exclusive Panels (About vs. Emoji)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two sibling panels, e.g.:\n",
    "  - Panel About\n",
    "  - Panel Emoji \n",
    "- Requirement:\n",
    "  - When About is shown, Emoji should be hidden.\n",
    "  - When Emoji is shown, About should be hidden. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem without lifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If each panel maintains its own local “open/closed” state, both can be open at the same time, causing inconsistent UI. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution with lifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Move the “which panel is open” state to their common parent. \n",
    "- Parent:\n",
    "  - Holds state indicating which panel is active.\n",
    "  - Passes down:\n",
    "    - Active state info.\n",
    "    - A function to change active panel. \n",
    "- Each panel:\n",
    "  - Uses props to know whether it should render itself.\n",
    "  - Calls the provided function to request state changes when clicked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When About is active:\n",
    "  - Emoji hides.\n",
    "- When Emoji becomes active:\n",
    "  - About hides.\n",
    "- Panels remain strictly mutually exclusive and fully synced. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2: Synced Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two input fields that should always show the **same text**:\n",
    "  - Typing in the first should update the second.\n",
    "  - Typing in the second should update the first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem without lifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If each input has its own local state, changes in one do not reflect in the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution with lifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- State is moved to the parent:\n",
    "  - Parent defines a single text state. \n",
    "- Both inputs receive:\n",
    "  - The same state value.\n",
    "  - The same state-updating function via props. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typing in input 1:\n",
    "  - Parent state updates.\n",
    "  - Input 2 receives new value via props and updates its display. \n",
    "- Typing in input 2:\n",
    "  - Same process in reverse.\n",
    "- Both inputs remain perfectly synchronized. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3: Filtering a List\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A search bar filters a list of items as the user types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem without lifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the filter text is maintained only in the search bar component, the list component may not get updated filtering criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution with lifting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parent component holds:\n",
    "  - `filterText` as state.\n",
    "  - The complete list of items. \n",
    "- Parent passes:\n",
    "  - `filterText` and its setter to the search bar.\n",
    "  - Filtered list (derived from `filterText`) or `filterText` itself to the list component. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the user types in the search bar:\n",
    "  - Parent `filterText` updates.\n",
    "  - List re-renders with items filtered based on updated `filterText`. \n",
    "- Search UI and list stay in sync with one shared state. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Lift State Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Lifting state up is useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple components need to **share and stay synchronized** on the same piece of data. \n",
    "- A **child’s changes must be visible or processed in a parent**. \n",
    "- Independent local states cause:\n",
    "  - Duplicate logic.\n",
    "  - Inconsistent UI.\n",
    "  - Bugs due to desynchronized values. \n",
    "\n",
    "General guideline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If two or more components need access to the same changing data, consider **moving that data and its updater to their closest common ancestor**. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Main Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Props flow one-way**: from parent to child; there is no built-in direct child-to-parent or sibling-to-sibling data flow. \n",
    "- **Lifting state up** means moving shared or important state from child components to their common parent so that the parent becomes the single source of truth. \n",
    "- The parent **creates, manages, and changes** the state using `useState` and passes:\n",
    "  - The state value.\n",
    "  - The state setter function to children via props. \n",
    "- Children use the received value for display and call the received setter function to request updates, enabling child-to-parent updates and sibling synchronization. \n",
    "- This pattern is essential for:\n",
    "  - Syncing sibling components (e.g., multiple cards, synced inputs).\n",
    "  - Controlling complex UIs (e.g., mutually exclusive panels, filtered lists).\n",
    "  - Avoiding inconsistent state spread across multiple components."
