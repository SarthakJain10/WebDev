    "# React Routing with React Router DOM \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Routing\n",
    "Routing enables navigation between multiple pages in a single-page application (SPA) without full page reloads. In React, routes are URLs or paths (e.g., `/home`, `/about`) that map to specific components. Traditional browser routing handles this server-side, but React Router DOM provides client-side routing for dynamic SPAs. Key distinction: **BrowserRouter** suits simple apps, while **createBrowserRouter** (from `react-router-dom`) supports advanced features like dynamic routing, nested routes, and error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Routes identify pages like `/` for home or `/dashboard` for a dashboard view. The lecture demonstrates transitioning from basic multi-page behavior to sophisticated React routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Setup and Routing\n",
    "Install `react-router-dom` via `npm install react-router-dom`. Create a new React project and set up routing in `App.js`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Basic Routes\n",
    "1. Import `createBrowserRouter` and `RouterProvider`.\n",
    "2. Define routes as an array of objects with `path` (URL pattern) and `element` (component to render).\n",
    "3. Provide routes via `<RouterProvider router={router}>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Code Structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "const router = createBrowserRouter([\n",
    "  { path: \"/\", element: <HomePage /> },\n",
    "  { path: \"/about\", element: <AboutPage /> },\n",
    "  { path: \"/dashboard\", element: <DashboardPage /> }\n",
    "]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Wrap your app root with `RouterProvider`. Create components like `HomePage.jsx` (`return <h1>Home Page</h1>;`) and map them to paths. Test by navigating: `/` loads Home, `/about` loads About.[3][4][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Pitfall:** Forgetting `RouterProvider` causes \"RouterProvider not defined\" errors. Ensure routes are provided to the app context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigation Components\n",
    "Avoid `<a>` tags as they cause full page reloads, breaking SPA behavior. Use React Router's links instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Link vs NavLink\n",
    "- **`<Link to=\"/about\">About</Link>`**: Basic navigation without page refresh.\n",
    "- **`<NavLink to=\"/about\" className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? 'active-link' : ''}>About</NavLink>`**: Adds `isActive` boolean for styling active routes (e.g., red border via CSS: `.active-link { border: 2px solid red; }`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `Navbar.jsx` with NavLinks for Home/About/Dashboard. Import and render in all pages or at app root for persistence.[5][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Routing with useParams\n",
    "Dynamic routes capture URL parameters using colons (`:`). Example: `/student/:id` treats `/student/abc123` as ID \"abc123\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ path: \"/student/:id\", element: <ParamComponent /> }\n",
    "```\n",
    "In `ParamComponent.jsx`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';\n",
    "const { id } = useParams(); // id = \"abc123\"\n",
    "return <h1>Student ID: {id}</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Distinguish **route parameters** (`/student/abc123`) from **query parameters** (`/student?id=abc123`, handled via `useSearchParams`).[1][5]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programmatic Navigation with useNavigate\n",
    "Navigate without links using the `useNavigate` hook for button clicks or logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in HomePage:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';\n",
    "const navigate = useNavigate();\n",
    "const handleClick = () => navigate('/about');\n",
    "return <button onClick={handleClick}>Move to About</button>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Clicking moves to `/about` without reload. Use in About to go to `/dashboard`.[6][5][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Routing\n",
    "Nested routes build hierarchical URLs (e.g., `/dashboard/courses`). Parent routes render children via `children` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  path: \"/dashboard\",\n",
    "  element: <DashboardPage />,\n",
    "  children: [\n",
    "    { path: \"courses\", element: <Courses /> },\n",
    "    { path: \"mock-test\", element: <MockTest /> },\n",
    "    { path: \"reports\", element: <Reports /> }\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "URLs become `/dashboard/courses`. Child paths are relative (no leading `/`). Use `<Outlet />` in parent (DashboardPage) to render active child:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';\n",
    "return (\n",
    "  <div>\n",
    "    <h1>Dashboard</h1>\n",
    "    <Outlet /> {/* Renders child */}\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Pitfall:** Child paths must be relative (e.g., `courses`, not `/courses`) to avoid \"absolute path\" errors.[7][8][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **createBrowserRouter** powers modern React routing with paths mapping to elements.[3]\n",
    "- Use `Link`/`NavLink` for UI navigation, `useParams` for dynamic data, `useNavigate` for programmatic moves, and `children`/`Outlet` for nesting.\n",
    "- Setup avoids reloads, enabling true SPA behavior. Practice with Home/About/Dashboard and nested Dashboard sections for mastery."
