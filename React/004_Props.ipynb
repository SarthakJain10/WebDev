    "# React Props: Children and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This lecture demonstrates advanced React props usage, focusing on **props.children** for passing content between component tags and passing **functions as props** for parent-child communication. The instructor builds practical examples from scratch using Vite, showing how these concepts enable flexible, reusable components like cards and buttons. Props (short for properties) act as data passed from parent to child components, extending basic text/image passing to dynamic content and behavior.[1][2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Props Children\n",
    "**Props.children** captures all content placed between a component's opening and closing tags, treating it as a single prop accessible via `props.children`. This works for text, HTML elements, nested components, or any JSX—making components highly flexible without predefined content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Any material between `<Component>` and `</Component>` becomes `children`, automatically available in the child component.\n",
    "- **Access Methods**:\n",
    "  - Direct: `{props.children}`\n",
    "  - Destructured: `const { children } = props; {children}`\n",
    "- **Key Benefits**:\n",
    "  - Builds **higher-order components (HOCs)** or wrappers that render unknown content dynamically.\n",
    "  - Example: A `Card` component renders whatever is passed inside it (e.g., headings, paragraphs).[4][5][6]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Live Example** (Card Component):\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// App.jsx (Parent)\n",
    "<Card>\n",
    "  <h1>Best Web Dev Course</h1>\n",
    "  <p>Try to be consistent</p>\n",
    "  <p>Will complete soon</p>\n",
    "</Card>\n",
    "\n",
    "// Card.jsx (Child)\n",
    "function Card(props) {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div className=\"card\">\n",
    "      {props.children}  // Renders all 3 elements\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Multiple or single children render identically; explicit `children` prop overrides implicit ones.[7][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Passing Functions as Props\n",
    "Functions pass from parent to child like any prop (using curly braces `{}`), enabling event handling and state updates across component boundaries. The child calls the parent's function via `props.functionName()`, typically on clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  1. Define function in parent (often with `useState` for state changes).\n",
    "  2. Pass as prop: `<Child onClick={parentFunction} />`.\n",
    "  3. Child invokes: `props.onClick()`.\n",
    "- **Avoids Infinite Loops**: Pass function reference (`{handleClick}`), not invocation (`{handleClick()}`).[8][9]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Live Example** (Counter Button):\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "// App.jsx (Parent)\n",
    "const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "const handleClick = () => setCount(count + 1);\n",
    "\n",
    "<Button onClick={handleClick} text=\"Click Me\">\n",
    "  <h1>{count}</h1>  // Child content\n",
    "</Button>\n",
    "\n",
    "// Button.jsx (Child)\n",
    "function Button(props) {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      {props.children}  // Shows count\n",
    "      <button onClick={props.onClick}>{props.text}</button>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Clicking increments parent's state; combines children + function props seamlessly.[10][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "- **Wrappers/HOCs**: Use `children` for reusable layouts (e.g., cards, modals) that accept arbitrary content.\n",
    "- **Event Delegation**: Functions enable reusable buttons handling parent logic (counters, forms).\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Same component adapts—pass 3 elements or plain text; any function works regardless of name.[11][12]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Master **props.children** for dynamic content passing between tags and **functions as props** for cross-component logic—core to building composable React UIs. Practice by creating Card/Button components; these enable HOCs and scalable apps. Next topics likely cover more advanced patterns."
