    "# Event Handling in React \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture explains how to handle events in React, such as clicks, mouse movements, input changes, and form submissions. It also covers important concepts like function references vs immediate invocation and event bubbling vs `stopPropagation`. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Event Handling in React?\n",
    "\n",
    "Event handling means responding to user actions like clicking a button, typing in an input, or submitting a form. In plain JavaScript, you manually fetch DOM elements and attach event listeners; in React, you directly attach event handlers using JSX props like `onClick` or `onChange`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Events are attached as props to JSX elements (e.g., `onClick`, `onMouseOver`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`). \n",
    "- These props expect a **function reference**, not the result of a function call. \n",
    "- React abstracts away manual DOM selection and listener attachment, making event handling simpler and more declarative. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Setup in React\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture starts by creating a React project (using Vite) and cleaning default boilerplate from `App.js` to keep only a basic `<div>` root structure. From there, examples for different events are built step by step in the main component. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Click Events on a Button\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple button click with handler function\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a button in JSX:\n",
    "   - Label: `\"Click Me\"` so that it appears on the page. \n",
    "2. Define a function in the component, e.g. `handleClick`, which shows an alert like “I am clicked.” \n",
    "3. Attach it to the button:\n",
    "   - Use `onClick={handleClick}` to connect the event to the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is convenient:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No need to select elements by `id` or `class` or use `addEventListener` as in plain JS. \n",
    "- React handles wiring up the event listener behind the scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using inline arrow functions vs named handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inline arrow form: passing an arrow function directly in `onClick` that calls `alert`. \n",
    "- Named handler function: define `handleClick` once and reuse it with `onClick={handleClick}`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inline arrow functions work but can make JSX bulkier and less readable for larger logic. \n",
    "- A separate handler function is cleaner and preferred for maintainable code. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mouse Events on Other Elements (Mouse Over)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: `onMouseOver` on a paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `<p>` element (e.g., text “I am para, I am a paragraph”). \n",
    "2. Style it inline to make it visible:\n",
    "   - Set `color` (e.g., red) and a `border` (e.g., `1px solid black`) so you can see its boundaries. \n",
    "3. Define a function `handleMouseOver` that shows an alert like “Mouse is over the paragraph.” \n",
    "4. Attach it: `onMouseOver={handleMouseOver}` on the `<p>` element. \n",
    "\n",
    "How it behaves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every time the mouse enters the paragraph area, the `handleMouseOver` function runs and shows the alert. \n",
    "- Moving away and re-entering triggers it again, demonstrating how mouse events are repeatedly fired. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Input Change with `onChange`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic `onChange` with console logging\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `<form>` and an `<input>` with `type=\"text\"`. \n",
    "2. Define function `handleInputChange` which logs a message like “Input value changed” in the console. \n",
    "3. Attach: `onChange={handleInputChange}` on the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every single character typed (or removed) triggers the `onChange` event and logs the message in the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing the current input value\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Print the current value as the user types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- React passes an event object to the handler when the event fires. \n",
    "- You can access the input’s current value using `event.target.value` inside the handler. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps illustrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a handler that receives `e` (the event) and logs `\"Value till now\"` plus `e.target.value`. \n",
    "2. Initially, an incorrect attempt used an arrow inline in a way that caused a syntax issue, leading to `e is not defined`. \n",
    "3. Fix: treat the event parameter properly in the handler and rely on React passing the event object automatically when the input triggers `onChange`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For an input’s `onChange`, the event object is always available and contains the latest information about the element, including `target.value`. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Form Submission with `onSubmit` and `preventDefault`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form submit flow in React\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the form, add a **submit button**: `<button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>`. \n",
    "2. Define a function `handleSubmit(e)` to handle the form’s submission event. \n",
    "3. Attach: `onSubmit={handleSubmit}` on the `<form>` element, not the button. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Preventing default browser behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Default browser behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submitting a form causes the page to refresh or navigate, and sends a request to the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `handleSubmit`, call `e.preventDefault()` to stop the page reload and server request. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement custom behavior, for example, triggering an alert like “Should I submit the form?” or performing custom logic with form data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always remember to use `e.preventDefault()` when handling form submissions in SPA-style React apps to prevent unnecessary reloads. \n",
    "- The `onSubmit` event is triggered when the user clicks the submit button or presses Enter inside the form. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Interview Concept: Function Reference vs Immediate Invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is highlighted as a frequently asked React interview question. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrong pattern: immediate invocation in `onClick`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example behavior described:\n",
    "\n",
    "- JSX is written such that `onClick` directly **invokes** a function or `alert` (e.g., `onClick={alert(\"Button clicked\")}` style pattern). \n",
    "- Effect:\n",
    "  - As soon as the component renders, the alert appears, **even before** any click. \n",
    "  - Clicking the button after that does **nothing**, because the handler was not a function reference but a value produced during render. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **immediate invocation** and is incorrect for event handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correct pattern: passing function reference\n",
    "\n",
    "Two correct ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pass a named function: `onClick={handleClick}` where `handleClick` is defined separately. \n",
    "- Use an arrow function: `onClick={() => handleClick()}` or `onClick={() => alert(\"Button clicked\")}`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- React stores the function, and only **invokes it when the event occurs** (when the user actually clicks). \n",
    "- On initial render, nothing extra runs except component rendering, so no unwanted alerts appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaway:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In handlers like `onClick`, always pass a **function reference**, not the **result** of a function call. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Event Bubbling and `stopPropagation`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is event bubbling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the DOM, when you click on an inner element (like a button inside nested `div`s), the click event first fires on the deepest element and then **bubbles up** through its ancestors. \n",
    "- So if each ancestor (`button`, inner `div`, outer `div`) has its own `onClick`, they will all run one after another from inner to outer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visual structure used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An outer `<div>` containing another `<div>`, which contains a `<button>`, all with `onClick` handlers. \n",
    "- Clicking the button:\n",
    "  - Button’s click handler fires.\n",
    "  - Then inner `div`’s click handler.\n",
    "  - Then outer `div`’s click handler. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `e.stopPropagation()` to stop bubbling\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When clicking the button, only the button’s handler should run, and outer handlers should not be triggered. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the button’s handler, call `e.stopPropagation()` on the event object. \n",
    "- This **stops the event from bubbling up** to parent elements, so their handlers do not run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click button → only button’s logic executes; outer `div` click handlers are not called. \n",
    "- Useful when you have parent click listeners for global behavior but want specific elements to opt out when clicked. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Color Switch Example from React Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture walks through a small application inspired by React’s official documentation that demonstrates multiple event handling concepts together. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the app\n",
    "\n",
    "- `index.html`:\n",
    "  - Contains a root element where React renders the main `App` component. \n",
    "- `App` component:\n",
    "  - Renders an **outer div** that tracks the number of clicks inside a region.\n",
    "  - Includes a `ColorSwitch` component responsible for changing the background color when its button is clicked. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Outer div: counting clicks\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer div behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has fixed width and height; acts as a clickable area. \n",
    "- `onClick` handler (e.g., `handleClickOutside`) increments a state variable that maintains the total number of clicks inside that region. \n",
    "- A piece of UI shows the number of clicks, like “Number of clicks: X”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clicks inside this outer div (except when stopped by `stopPropagation`) increase the count. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inner ColorSwitch component: changing color without affecting count\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the outer div:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `ColorSwitch` component contains a button (e.g., “Change Color”). \n",
    "- The button has an `onClick` handler that:\n",
    "  - Calls `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent the click from bubbling to the outer div.\n",
    "  - Calls a `onChangeColor` function passed as props from `App` to change the color. \n",
    "\n",
    "Color change logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A helper function computes a random color value. \n",
    "- `onChangeColor` uses that random color and updates something like `document.body.style.backgroundColor` (or similar) to apply the new color. \n",
    "\n",
    "Net effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clicking **anywhere** inside the outer div (except the ColorSwitch button) increments the click count. \n",
    "- Clicking the “Change Color” button:\n",
    "  - Changes the background color.\n",
    "  - Does **not** increment the click count due to `stopPropagation`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts combined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- State updates via a click handler on the outer div. \n",
    "- Event bubbling control via `e.stopPropagation()` on the inner button. \n",
    "- Passing event-handling functions as props between components. \n",
    "- Using events to drive UI changes (color and count). \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Key Points Emphasized\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reading official documentation is critical for mastering React concepts like event handling. \n",
    "- Real-world developers regularly consult documentation, Stack Overflow, and tools like GPT; memorizing everything is neither practical nor expected. \n",
    "- Practicing by recreating examples (like the Color Switch app) helps internalize event behavior, bubbling, and correct handler patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Main Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- React simplifies event handling by letting you attach events directly in JSX using props like `onClick`, `onMouseOver`, `onChange`, and `onSubmit`. \n",
    "- For all event props, always pass a **function reference**, not the direct call result; otherwise, you get unwanted immediate execution on render. \n",
    "- Use the event object (`e`) to read information such as `e.target.value` for input fields, and use `e.preventDefault()` to override default form submission behavior. \n",
    "- Understand event bubbling: inner clicks can trigger outer handlers unless you call `e.stopPropagation()` to stop the event from traveling up. \n",
    "- The Color Switch example combines state, event handlers, and bubbling control to demonstrate robust React event handling patterns you should practice implementing yourself."
