    "# React useEffect Hook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to useEffect\n",
    "The **useEffect** Hook is a React feature that handles **side effects** in functional components, such as API calls, DOM updates, timers, or database connections. Side effects occur outside React's normal rendering flow, like excessive scrolling causing eye strain or a render triggering an API fetch. Unlike class components' lifecycle methods, useEffect runs after render by default and must be placed at the top level of a component. It takes a setup function (containing side effect logic), an optional cleanup function, and a dependency array to control execution.[1][2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Key structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  // Side effect logic (setup)\n",
    "  return () => {\n",
    "    // Cleanup logic (optional)\n",
    "  };\n",
    "}, [dependencies]); // Controls when it re-runs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Side Effects?\n",
    "Side effects are unintended consequences of an action, such as:\n",
    "- DOM content loading → establishing a database connection.\n",
    "- Component render → making an API call.\n",
    "- State update (e.g., counter increment) → showing an alert or toast.\n",
    "- User login → fetching profile image from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "These synchronize React components with external systems like APIs, timers, or event listeners. Without useEffect, such logic would clutter render functions.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## useEffect Syntax Breakdown\n",
    "useEffect accepts three parts:\n",
    "- **Side Effect Function**: Contains the main logic (e.g., `fetch()` API, `console.log()`).\n",
    "- **Cleanup Function** (returned from setup): Runs before the next effect or on unmount to prevent memory leaks (e.g., clear intervals, remove event listeners).\n",
    "- **Dependency Array**: Reactive values (props/state) that trigger re-execution when changed. Use `Object.is` for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always import: `import { useEffect } from 'react';`. Place at component top, not in loops/conditions.[4][1][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variations of useEffect\n",
    "The dependency array creates different behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Runs on Every Render (No Dependencies)\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  alert(\"Runs on every render\");\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Executes after every render (including state changes).\n",
    "- Example: Counter app increments → re-render → alert fires each time.[1][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Runs Only on First Render (Empty Array)\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  alert(\"Runs only on first render\");\n",
    "}, []);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Mounts once, ignores re-renders.\n",
    "- Ideal for one-time setup like initial API fetches.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Runs on Specific Dependency Change (Single Item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  alert(`Count updated to ${count}`);\n",
    "}, [count]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Initial render + whenever `count` changes.\n",
    "- Fires on initial 0 and each increment.[4][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Multiple Dependencies\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  alert(\"Count or total updated\");\n",
    "}, [count, total]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Triggers if any listed value changes.\n",
    "- Useful for related states like counters.[5][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. With Cleanup Function\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  alert(\"Count updated\");\n",
    "  return () => {\n",
    "    alert(\"Component unmounting or count changing\");\n",
    "  };\n",
    "}, [count]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Cleanup runs before next effect (on dependency change) or on unmount.\n",
    "- Prevents leaks: old value unmounts → cleanup → new value mounts.[6][3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development Note**: Strict Mode runs effects twice for testing; ensure cleanup mirrors setup.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Examples\n",
    "### Logger Component\n",
    "- Logs on every render: `console.log(\"Component rendered, count:\", count)`.\n",
    "- Demonstrates infinite re-runs without dependencies.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timer Component\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  const id = setInterval(() => setSeconds(s => s + 1), 1000);\n",
    "  return () => clearInterval(id);\n",
    "}, []);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Runs once: increments seconds every second.\n",
    "- Cleanup stops interval on unmount.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Fetcher\n",
    "```\n",
    "const [data, setData] = useState([]);\n",
    "const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  setLoading(true);\n",
    "  fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')\n",
    "    .then(res => res.json())\n",
    "    .then(result => {\n",
    "      setData(result);\n",
    "      setLoading(false);\n",
    "    });\n",
    "}, []);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Fetches once: shows \"Loading...\" → list of items.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resize Listener\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  const handleResize = () => setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth);\n",
    "  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);\n",
    "  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);\n",
    "}, []);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Tracks window width live; cleans up listener.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Effect Component\n",
    "Combines logger, data fetch, timer, and resize for real-world sync.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleanup Function Details\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Mirrors setup (e.g., `connect()` → `disconnect()`).\n",
    "- **Timing**: Before re-run (dependency change), final unmount, or Strict Mode double-run.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - Timers: `setInterval` → `clearInterval`.\n",
    "  - Events: `addEventListener` → `removeEventListener`.\n",
    "  - Connections: Database open → close.\n",
    "- Avoid leaks like persistent intervals after unmount.[7][6][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices\n",
    "- **Infinite Loops**: Dependency updates state → re-render → loop. Fix: Use updater functions like `setCount(c => c + 1)`.\n",
    "- **Missing Dependencies**: Linter warns; always list reactive values or refactor.\n",
    "- **Objects/Functions as Dependencies**: Create inside effect to avoid re-creation.\n",
    "- **Server-Side**: Effects skip SSR; use state flags for client-only content.\n",
    "- Use custom Hooks for reusable effects (e.g., `useChatRoom`).[4][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "useEffect manages side effects via setup/cleanup and dependency-driven re-execution: no array (every render), empty (mount only), or specific values (on change). Master variations through counters, timers, fetches, and listeners; always pair cleanup with setup to avoid leaks. Practice with clean projects for confidence—key for MERN stack apps."
