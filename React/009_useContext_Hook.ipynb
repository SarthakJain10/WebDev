    "# React `useContext` Hook and Context API \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture explains the React Context API and the `useContext` hook by starting from the problem of prop drilling and then building practical examples, including a theme toggler and multiple contexts (user + theme). The main goals are to understand what prop drilling is, why it is problematic, and how `createContext`, Provider, and `useContext` work together to solve it in React applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prop Drilling Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Prop drilling occurs when data from a parent component must be passed down through several intermediate components that do not actually need that data, just so a deeply nested child can finally use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine:\n",
    "  - A Parent component contains several nested children: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 in a hierarchy. \n",
    "  - Parent has a prop that only component C5 needs. \n",
    "- Traditional props-based approach:\n",
    "  - Parent → C3 → C4 → C5.\n",
    "  - C3 and C4 receive the prop only to pass it further down, even though they never use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why prop drilling is bad:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intermediate components receive unnecessary data, increasing coupling between components. \n",
    "- Component trees in real apps are often large, so data may pass through many layers, making code harder to maintain and reason about. \n",
    "- Any change to the prop’s structure can force changes in multiple intermediate components that only forward the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation for Context API\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid prop drilling, React provides Context, which allows data to be shared across a component tree without manually passing props through each level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The component that has the data acts as a **Provider**.\n",
    "- Any component that needs the data becomes a **Consumer**.\n",
    "- Intermediate components that do not need the data are not forced to receive or forward it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaner component interfaces (fewer props purely for forwarding). \n",
    "- Easier to manage global or semi-global data like theme, user info, auth state, etc. \n",
    "- More scalable when the component hierarchy becomes deep. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three/Four Core Steps of Using Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture explains the pattern as three main steps (often seen as four when splitting “use value + export”). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `createContext` to create a context object. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Example conceptual pattern:\n",
    "  - `const UserContext = createContext();`. \n",
    "- This context object will later be used to:\n",
    "  - Wrap children using `UserContext.Provider`.\n",
    "  - Consume data using `useContext(UserContext)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context can be created either in the parent component file or in a separate file dedicated to context. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Wrap Children in a Provider\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the created context’s `Provider` component to wrap all children that should be able to access the shared data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Concept:\n",
    "  - `UserContext.Provider` wraps ChildA.\n",
    "  - ChildB is inside ChildA, and ChildC is inside ChildB.\n",
    "  - Since ChildA is inside the Provider, all nested children (A, B, C) can become consumers if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Critical point:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any component that may need to consume the context value in the future must be inside the Provider’s subtree. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pass the Value into Provider\n",
    "\n",
    "The Provider receives a `value` prop, which is the data you want to share. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Example pattern:\n",
    "  - `value={user}` where `user` might be an object from `useState` (e.g., `{ name: \"Love\" }`). \n",
    "- Steps done so far:\n",
    "  - Step 1: Create context.\n",
    "  - Step 2: Wrap children in Provider.\n",
    "  - Step 3: Pass `value` into Provider. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Consume Context with `useContext`\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside any consumer component (e.g., ChildC), use the `useContext` hook to read the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Conceptual pattern:\n",
    "  - Import the context: `UserContext`.\n",
    "  - `const user = useContext(UserContext);`. \n",
    "  - Use `user.name` (e.g., to render `Love`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create context (e.g., `UserContext = createContext()`). \n",
    "2. Wrap children in `<UserContext.Provider>` in the component that has the data. \n",
    "3. Pass `value` to Provider (e.g., `value={user}` or `value={{ theme, setTheme }}`). \n",
    "4. In any descendant component, call `useContext(UserContext)` to consume the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple User Context Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture first builds a basic example with a `UserContext` to demonstrate one-way data flow without prop drilling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Component hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `App` (parent / top-level).\n",
    "- `ChildA` inside `App`.\n",
    "- `ChildB` inside `ChildA`.\n",
    "- `ChildC` inside `ChildB`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `App`:\n",
    "  - Create `UserContext` with `createContext()`. \n",
    "  - Use `useState` to hold user data, e.g., `const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: \"Love\" });`. \n",
    "  - Wrap `<ChildA />` with `<UserContext.Provider value={user}>`. \n",
    "- In `ChildC`:\n",
    "  - Import `UserContext`.\n",
    "  - `const user = useContext(UserContext);`. \n",
    "  - Render `user.name`, which prints the user’s name coming directly from `App` without passing props through `ChildA` and `ChildB`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parent provides data via Provider.\n",
    "- Deep child consumes data via `useContext`, skipping intermediate prop passing. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theme Context Example with Toggling\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture then creates a more interesting project: a theme toggler using Context to show UI changes based on a global state (theme). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Component Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy (same pattern):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `App` (top-level).\n",
    "- `ChildA` inside `App`.\n",
    "- `ChildB` inside `ChildA`.\n",
    "- `ChildC` inside `ChildB`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `App` holds `theme` state (`\"light\"` or `\"dark\"`).\n",
    "- `ChildC` has a button to toggle the theme.\n",
    "- A container’s background color changes based on the current theme. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Theme Context and State\n",
    "\n",
    "In `App`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create context:\n",
    "  - `const ThemeContext = createContext();`. \n",
    "- Create state:\n",
    "  - `const [theme, setTheme] = useState(\"light\");`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Providing Theme Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap the target subtree with Provider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>`\n",
    "  - Place `<ChildA />` inside this provider. \n",
    "- This makes `theme` accessible in any nested component (ChildA, ChildB, ChildC). \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, to allow toggling, the value is changed to include both `theme` and `setTheme`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `value={{ theme, setTheme }}` so consumers can both read and update theme. \n",
    "\n",
    "### CSS and Container Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In `App`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a container `div` with id `container` and place `<ChildA />` inside it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In CSS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Style `#container`:\n",
    "  - Height and width (e.g., 200px each).\n",
    "  - Border like `1px solid black`.\n",
    "  - `display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`.\n",
    "  - `justify-content: center`, `align-items: center` to center content. \n",
    "  - Initial `background-color` set to something like beige. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, the `background-color` will depend on the current `theme` (light or dark). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Consuming Theme and Toggling in ChildC\n",
    "\n",
    "In `ChildC`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import `ThemeContext`.\n",
    "2. Use `useContext`:\n",
    "   - Initially: `const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);` to read theme. \n",
    "   - After adding `setTheme`, destructure both:\n",
    "     - `const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);`. \n",
    "3. Add a button:\n",
    "   - Label: e.g., “Change Theme”. \n",
    "   - Attach `onClick` to a handler function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handler logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `ChildC`, define a `handleClick` (or `toggleTheme`) that switches between `\"light\"` and `\"dark\"` using `setTheme`:\n",
    "  - If `theme === \"light\"`, set it to `\"dark\"`.\n",
    "  - Else set it back to `\"light\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying Theme to UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in `App`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use inline style on the container `div`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Background color depends on `theme`:\n",
    "    - If `theme === \"light\"`, use beige (or some light color).\n",
    "    - Else use black. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, theme is `\"light\"`, so background is light/beige. \n",
    "- Clicking “Change Theme”:\n",
    "  - Toggles `theme` to `\"dark\"`.\n",
    "  - The container background becomes black. \n",
    "- Clicking again toggles back to `\"light\"`, background returns to light. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context makes both `theme` and `setTheme` available deep in the tree.\n",
    "- The deep child can change global UI state without prop drilling. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Multiple Contexts Together\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture also demonstrates that multiple contexts can coexist in the same parent component. \n",
    "\n",
    "Contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `UserContext` (with example user data, e.g., `{ name: \"Love\" }`). \n",
    "- `ThemeContext` (with `theme` and `setTheme`). \n",
    "\n",
    "In `App`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both contexts are created using `createContext()`. \n",
    "- User data is stored via `useState` and provided via `UserContext.Provider`. \n",
    "- Theme data/state is provided via `ThemeContext.Provider`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Provider nesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One provider wraps the other:\n",
    "  - For example:\n",
    "    - Outer: `<UserContext.Provider value={user}>`\n",
    "    - Inner: `<ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>`\n",
    "    - Inside: `<ChildA />`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any nested component (like `ChildC`) now has access to both user and theme contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `ChildC`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import both contexts: `UserContext`, `ThemeContext`. \n",
    "- Use them:\n",
    "  - `const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);`\n",
    "  - `const user = useContext(UserContext);`. \n",
    "- Use `user.name` to display user info and `theme`/`setTheme` for theme toggling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- React supports multiple independent contexts.\n",
    "- Providers can be nested, and each provider grants access to its value for all descendants. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Terms and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context**: A mechanism in React for passing data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level. \n",
    "- **`createContext()`**: Function used to create a new context object. \n",
    "- **Provider**:\n",
    "  - A component (e.g., `UserContext.Provider`) that makes a value available to all its descendants. \n",
    "  - Accepts a `value` prop containing the shared data (state, functions, objects, etc.). \n",
    "- **Consumer / `useContext`**:\n",
    "  - Consumers are components that call `useContext(SomeContext)` to read the value. \n",
    "  - `useContext` subscribes to the nearest matching Provider above in the tree. \n",
    "- **Prop Drilling**:\n",
    "  - Passing props down multiple levels just to reach a deep child, even when intermediate components do not need the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Patterns to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Context and `useContext`, follow this mental checklist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the context**:\n",
    "   - `const SomeContext = createContext();`. \n",
    "2. **Create the data (possibly state)**:\n",
    "   - For static data: define variables/objects.\n",
    "   - For dynamic data: use `useState`, `useReducer`, etc. \n",
    "3. **Wrap the relevant subtree in Provider and pass value**:\n",
    "   - `<SomeContext.Provider value={valueToShare}>`.\n",
    "   - Place all components that need access inside this Provider. \n",
    "4. **Export the context**:\n",
    "   - `export default SomeContext;` or `export { SomeContext };` so other components can import it. \n",
    "5. **Consume using `useContext` in any descendant**:\n",
    "   - `const data = useContext(SomeContext);`. \n",
    "   - Use `data` in JSX or logic as required (render, toggle, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Main Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prop drilling is the practice of passing data through many components that do not need it, just to reach a nested component, which makes code messy and harder to maintain. \n",
    "- React Context API, combined with the `useContext` hook, solves prop drilling by letting a Provider component share data with any descendant Consumer without intermediate props. \n",
    "- The typical workflow is:\n",
    "  1. Create context with `createContext()`.\n",
    "  2. Wrap needed components in the context’s Provider.\n",
    "  3. Pass data via the Provider’s `value` prop.\n",
    "  4. Use `useContext` in descendants to consume that value. \n",
    "- A theme toggler example shows how a deep child can both read and update global theme state and how UI (like container background) reacts to theme changes. \n",
    "- Multiple contexts (e.g., `UserContext` and `ThemeContext`) can be used together, with nested Providers, enabling components to access multiple independent pieces of shared state without prop drilling. \n"
