    "# Next.js Layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Layouts\n",
    "Layouts in Next.js enable consistent UI elements across multiple pages without repetition. The root `layout.tsx` file in the `app` directory is mandatory and wraps all pages with shared components like navigation bars and footers. This file must include `<html>` and `<body>` tags, containing `{children}` to render page content.[1][2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits include persistent elements (e.g., navbars) and metadata control like page titles. Layouts persist across route changes, unlike page components that re-render.[4][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating the Root Layout\n",
    "Start by generating a Next.js app with `npx create-next-app@latest layouts --use-npm`, selecting defaults. Edit `app/layout.tsx` to add components:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import Navbar from '@/components/Navbar';\n",
    "import Footer from '@/components/Footer';\n",
    "\n",
    "export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "      <body>\n",
    "        <Navbar />\n",
    "        {children}\n",
    "        <Footer />\n",
    "      </body>\n",
    "    </html>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Components like `Navbar` and `Footer` (created in `components/` via `rfc`) appear on every page, such as `app/page.tsx` displaying \"I am home page\".[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Layouts\n",
    "Create folder-specific layouts for grouped pages. For an `admin` folder with `login/page.tsx`, `logout/page.tsx`, and `comments/page.tsx`, add `admin/layout.tsx`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export default function AdminLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <span>Admin Nav Bar</span>\n",
    "      {children}\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies only to `/admin/*` routes, nesting inside the root layout (root nav + admin nav + page + root footer). Deeper nesting (e.g., `admin/logout/layout.tsx`) stacks layouts: root → admin → logout.[5][6][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Route Groups for Clean URLs\n",
    "Group routes without affecting URLs using parentheses, e.g., `app/(admin)/login/page.tsx` and `app/(admin)/comments/page.tsx` with `(admin)/layout.tsx`. The folder `(admin)` doesn't appear in paths like `/login` or `/comments`, but applies the admin layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "app/\n",
    "  (admin)/\n",
    "    layout.tsx  // Admin-specific layout\n",
    "    login/\n",
    "      page.tsx  // /login\n",
    "    comments/\n",
    "      page.tsx  // /comments\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This organizes routes while maintaining custom layouts without extra URL segments.[7][1][5]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metadata and Advanced Features\n",
    "Set page titles dynamically in layouts via `<title>` or `generateMetadata` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n",
    "  return { title: `Admin ${params.slug}` };\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Tailwind CSS (via `npm i -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`) for styling headers/footers. Layouts support server components for SEO-optimized metadata.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Next.js layouts provide reusable UI structures: root for global elements, nested for sections, and route groups for organization without URL pollution. Practice by building admin panels to master nesting and metadata—essential for scalable apps over plain React."
