    "# Environment Variables in Next.js\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Environment variables store configuration settings like API keys, database credentials, or emails separately from code. Next.js supports them natively through `.env*` files to avoid hardcoding sensitive data, prevent accidental commits to GitHub, and enable easy changes across development and production environments. They load into `process.env` for use in server-side code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating and Loading Environment Variables\n",
    "Create a `.env` file in the project root with key-value pairs, such as `SECRET=harry123456` and `ID=harry`. Run `npm run dev` to start the app; Next.js automatically loads these into `process.env`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Access in **server components**: Use `console.log(process.env.ID)` or display directly, as server-side rendering has full access.  \n",
    "- Files are gitignored by default in `create-next-app` templates to protect secrets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Term**: `.env` files support multiline values and variable referencing with `$VARIABLE`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Server vs Client Components\n",
    "Server components access all `process.env` variables securely, printing values like `ID=harry` and `SECRET=harry123456`. Client components (`\"use client\"`) cannot access non-public env vars due to browser security; attempts return `undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Server-side**: Safe for secrets like database passwords.\n",
    "- **Client-side**: Env vars run in browser's `process.env`, excluding server-only data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Environment Variables for Client Access\n",
    "Prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_ID=harry`) to bundle into JavaScript for client-side use. Next.js inlines these at build time, replacing `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ID` with the literal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# .env\n",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_ID=harry\n",
    "```\n",
    "Access works in both server and client components, but avoid for sensitive data—attackers can extract from bundles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**: Public vars freeze at `next build`; changes require rebuild. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading Priority and Order\n",
    "Next.js loads env vars in strict order, using the first match:  \n",
    "\n",
    "| Priority Order | File Example (NODE_ENV=development) | Notes |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------|\n",
    "| 1. System    | `process.env`                      | OS-level vars   |\n",
    "| 2. Environment-specific local | `.env.development.local` | Overrides for dev, gitignored |\n",
    "| 3. Local     | `.env.local`                       | Local overrides (skipped in tests)   |\n",
    "| 4. Environment-specific | `.env.development` | Dev defaults |\n",
    "| 5. Default   | `.env`                             | Fallback for all   |\n",
    "\n",
    "`.env.local` takes precedence over `.env` for local tweaks like different MongoDB URIs. For tests, use `.env.test`; `NODE_ENV=test` skips `.env.local`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices and Advanced Usage\n",
    "- Use `@next/env` `loadEnvConfig(process.cwd())` for non-Next.js contexts like ORMs. \n",
    "- Separate local/production vars with `.env.development` vs `.env.production`. \n",
    "- Never commit secrets; use platform env vars (e.g., Vercel dashboard) for deployment.\n",
    "- Runtime vars: Available server-side during dynamic rendering; public ones are build-time only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Next.js env vars enhance security and flexibility: use `.env*` files with priority order, prefix `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client access, and distinguish server/client behavior. Focus on `.env.local` and `.env` for 95% of cases, reserving public vars for non-sensitive data like analytics IDs."
