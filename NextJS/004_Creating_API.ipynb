    "# Creating APIs in Next.js (App Router)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Next.js serves as both a frontend and backend framework, enabling developers to create API endpoints directly within the application. This tutorial demonstrates building API routes using the App Router's `route.js` files, which handle HTTP requests like POST without needing separate backend servers. The process involves setting up a project, creating organized folder structures, and implementing request handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Setup\n",
    "Start by creating a new Next.js project and navigating to its directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run `npx create-next-app@latest api-routes` (or similar) to initialize with default settings.\n",
    "- Open in VS Code and start the development server using `npm run dev`.\n",
    "- The basic app runs at `localhost:3000`, confirming the setup works.\n",
    "\n",
    "This establishes a foundation where API routes integrate seamlessly with the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating API Routes\n",
    "API routes live in the `app` directory under a custom folder like `api` for organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create `app/api/add/route.js` – the `route.js` file signals Next.js to treat this path (`/api/add`) as an API endpoint, similar to `page.js` for pages.\n",
    "- Inside `route.js`, export named functions matching HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`.\n",
    "- Only the function for the incoming request method executes; others can be omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This file-based routing simplifies endpoint creation and supports dynamic paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling POST Requests\n",
    "Focus on POST for this demo, which commonly creates or submits data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic POST Handler:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n",
    "\n",
    "export async function POST(request) {\n",
    "  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data: \"Yes\" });\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Import `NextResponse` from `next/server`.\n",
    "- The function receives a `request` object and returns JSON via `NextResponse.json()`.\n",
    "- Test by accessing `/api/add` – it responds with the fixed JSON object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing Request Data:**\n",
    "- Extract body with `const data = await request.json()`.\n",
    "- Echo back: `return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data })` (shorthand sends received data under `data` key).\n",
    "- Example input `{ name: \"Harry\", role: \"Coder\" }` returns `{ success: true, data: { name: \"Harry\", role: \"Coder\" } }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headers like `Content-Type: application/json` must match for proper parsing.[7][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frontend Integration Example\n",
    "Test APIs from the frontend using Fetch API in a client component.\n",
    "\n",
    "**page.js Setup:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "'use client';\n",
    "export default function Home() {\n",
    "  const handleClick = async () => {\n",
    "    const data = { name: \"Harry\", role: \"Coder\" };\n",
    "    const res = await fetch('/api/add', {\n",
    "      method: 'POST',\n",
    "      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n",
    "      body: JSON.stringify(data)\n",
    "    });\n",
    "    const result = await res.json();\n",
    "    console.log(result);\n",
    "  };\n",
    "\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <h1>Next.js API Routes Demo</h1>\n",
    "      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Mark as `'use client'` to enable event handlers.\n",
    "- `fetch` sends POST to `/api/add`, awaits JSON response, and logs it (e.g., success with echoed data).\n",
    "- Update data like `name: \"Shubham\"` to see changes reflected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates full-stack interaction within one app.[1][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "Next.js App Router API routes use `route.js` files in `app/api/[endpoint]/` to handle all HTTP methods efficiently. POST handlers process JSON bodies via `request.json()` and respond with `NextResponse.json()`, enabling seamless frontend-backend integration. Future projects will expand on GET, PUT, DELETE, and real data operations."
