    "# Next.js Server Components: Fundamentals and Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Server Components\n",
    "Server Components represent the default behavior in Next.js App Router (Next.js 13+), where components render entirely on the server before sending HTML to the browser.  This approach contrasts with traditional React, where all components run in the browser, by enabling server-side execution for better performance and security.  The lecture demonstrates creating a Next.js 14 project to highlight this shift, emphasizing that hooks like `useState` fail in server contexts without explicit client marking.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences: Server vs Client Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Server Components execute only on the server, producing static HTML without JavaScript bundles sent to the client, which reduces load times.  Client Components, marked with **`\"use client\"`** at the file top, run in the browser for interactivity like state management or event handling.    \n",

    "\n",
    "## Practical Examples and Demonstrations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Basic Server Component\n",
    "In `app/page.js`, components run as Server Components by default:\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "export default function Page() {\n",
    "  return <div>Server-rendered content</div>;  // Runs on server, no JS to client\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Adding `useState` throws errors, as hooks require client runtime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting to Client Component\n",
    "Add **`\"use client\"`**:\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "\"use client\";\n",
    "import { useState } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "export default function Counter() {\n",
    "  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n",
    "      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me</button>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This enables state and clicks but sends JS to the browser.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Server-Side File Reading (Exclusive to Server)\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "import fs from 'fs/promises';\n",
    "\n",
    "export default async function ServerPage() {\n",
    "  const data = await fs.readFile('.gitignore', 'utf8');\n",
    "  return <pre>{data}</pre>;  // Secure: FS unavailable in browser\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fails in Client Components due to browser restrictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Components Strategy\n",
    "Keep most UI as Server Components; extract interactive parts (e.g., Navbar) to separate Client files:\n",
    "- `components/Navbar.js`: `\"use client\"` + `useState`.\n",
    "- Import into `page.js` (Server): `<Navbar />`.\n",
    "This minimizes client JS while enabling targeted interactivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Fetching with JSON\n",
    "Import local JSON in Server Components for server-side rendering:\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "import data from './data.json';\n",
    "export default function Page() {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      {data.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ideal for static or database data without exposing logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Each Component Type\n",
    "- **Server Components** (default): Data-heavy pages, authentication, file/DB access—prioritize speed and security.  \n",
    "- **Client Components**: User interactions (buttons, forms)—use sparingly to avoid bundle bloat. \n",
    "- Best Practice: \"Move client logic to leaves\"—nest Client Components deeply within Server trees for optimal performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next.js as a full-stack framework handles both seamlessly in App Router.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Takeaways\n",
    "Server Components default in Next.js App Router for faster, secure rendering without client JS; add **`\"use client\"`** only for interactivity.  Combine them hierarchically: Server for data/logic, Client for UI state—extract small interactive islands.  This pattern enhances performance in real projects, with console logs distinguishing environments.  Practice by building projects from the Sigma Web Dev playlist."
