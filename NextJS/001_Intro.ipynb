    "# Next.js Introduction and File-Based Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Next.js?\n",
    "Next.js serves as a React framework designed for building large-scale applications and complex projects, such as clones of sites like Airbnb, YouTube, or GitHub.  It extends React by providing built-in features like file-based routing, eliminating the need for separate router packages, along with API creation capabilities, SEO tools, and optimized data rendering methods.  These additions simplify development for full-stack solutions while maintaining React's component model.[1][2][3][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up a Next.js Project\n",
    "Use the command `npx create-next-app@latest` to initialize a new project interactively.  This prompts for options including:[5][6][7][1]\n",
    "- **Project name**: Choose a name like \"first\" for the app directory.\n",
    "- **TypeScript**: Select \"No\" for beginners using plain JavaScript.\n",
    "- **ESLint**: Enable \"Yes\" for code linting.\n",
    "- **Tailwind CSS**: Enable \"Yes\" for utility-first styling.\n",
    "- **src/ directory**: Select \"No\" to use the default app structure.\n",
    "- **App Router**: Enable \"Yes\" (recommended as the future standard over Pages Router).[8][9][1]\n",
    "- **Import alias**: Default \"@/*\" simplifies imports by pointing to the root project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setup, navigate to the project folder (e.g., via `code .` or `code -r first`), install Node.js if needed, and run `npm run dev` to start the development server at `localhost:3000`.[1][5]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Folder Structure and App Router\n",
    "Next.js 13+ uses the **App Router** in the `app/` directory for modern routing, unlike the older Pages Router (`pages/` directory).  Key folders include:[3][10][8][1]\n",
    "- `app/`: Core for routing—files here define routes.\n",
    "- `public/`: Static assets like images.\n",
    "- `components/`: Reusable UI elements (create as needed).\n",
    "- `node_modules/`: Dependencies.\n",
    "- Generated files: Tailwind config, ESLint setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root `layout.tsx` (or `.js`) provides global HTML structure (e.g., `<html>`, `<body>`), shared across pages.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## File-Based Routing\n",
    "**File-based routing** maps folders and `page.js` (or `.tsx`) files in `app/` directly to URLs—no manual route configuration required.[2][11][12][13][1]\n",
    "- `/app/page.js` → `/` (home page).\n",
    "- `/app/about/page.js` → `/about`.\n",
    "- `/app/contact/page.js` → `/contact`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Setup**:\n",
    "1. Edit `app/page.js`: Replace content with `<div>I am home page</div>`—loads at `/`.\n",
    "2. Create `app/about/page.js`: Add `<div>I am about</div>`—accessible at `/about`.\n",
    "3. Create `app/contact/page.js`: Add `<div>I am contact</div>`—accessible at `/contact`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This convention simplifies scaling for nested or dynamic routes (covered in advanced topics).[4][13][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Components and Layouts\n",
    "- Create reusable components in `components/` (e.g., `navbar.js` with `<div>I am navbar</div>`).\n",
    "- Import using `@/components/navbar` (alias avoids relative paths like `../../../`).[1]\n",
    "- Add to `app/layout.js` after `<body>`: `import NavBar from '@/components/navbar'; <NavBar />`—appears on all pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**: Consistent navigation without per-page imports; leverages React components seamlessly.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features Highlighted\n",
    "- **Full-stack solution**: Combines frontend React with backend API routes.\n",
    "- **File-based routing**: Automatic URL mapping.\n",
    "- **Next Navigation**: `router` from `next/navigation` for programmatic navigation (advanced).\n",
    "- **Optimized rendering**: Server-side options like SSR/SSG for performance.\n",
    "- **Customization**: Edit `layout.js` for `<title>` (e.g., \"I am a blog\") and `<meta name=\"description\">` (shows in page metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Tailwind for styling (e.g., `<h1 className=\"text-4xl\">Problem solved by Next.js</h1>` on `/about`).[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Next.js builds on React with file-based routing via the App Router (`app/` directory), simplifying large app development through `npx create-next-app@latest`, automatic route mapping (`page.js` files), shared layouts, and import aliases.  Core takeaways: Setup yields a dev server at `localhost:3000`; folders define routes; components integrate easily for scalable UIs. Students should practice creating pages like `/about` and `/contact`, then explore the Sigma playlist for deeper features like APIs and rendering."
