    "# Next.js Data Fetching: SSR, SSG, and ISR\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Next.js supports three primary data fetching strategies in its App Router: **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, and **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**. These methods determine when and how pages render and fetch data, balancing performance, freshness, and cost. By default, components are server components unless marked with `'use client'`, enabling server-side execution for data fetching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\n",
    "SSR renders pages on the server for each request, ideal for dynamic, user-specific content like personalized dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Default behavior: Components without `'use client'` run on the server; `console.log` statements appear in server logs, not browser console.[1]\n",
    "- Data fetching occurs server-side via `fetch` or database calls during each request.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Functions** trigger SSR: `cookies()`, `headers()`, or `searchParams` force request-time rendering.\n",
    "- To force SSR explicitly: Export `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` in the page file, preventing static pre-rendering.\n",
    "- Trade-offs: Higher server load but always fresh data; no caching by default unless specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Adding `dynamic: 'force-dynamic'` changes build output from \"Static\" to \"Dynamic\" page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static Site Generation (SSG)\n",
    "SSG pre-renders pages at **build time** (`npm run build`), generating static HTML for fast CDN delivery without network calls per request.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Triggers automatically: Pages without dynamic functions or uncached fetches become static.[3]\n",
    "- No network calls during rendering means instant loads; cached via Data Cache.\n",
    "- Build log shows \"○ (Static)\" for qualifying pages like simple homepages.[1]\n",
    "- Benefits: Optimal for unchanging content (e.g., marketing pages, blog posts); reduces costs and latency.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A basic page with static text renders as \"pre-rendered as static content\" during build.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\n",
    "ISR combines SSG speed with periodic updates, regenerating static pages in the background after a set interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses Next.js `fetch` with `{ next: { revalidate: seconds } }` (e.g., `revalidate: 3600` for hourly updates).[7][1]\n",
    "- Serves cached static page initially; regenerates on next request after interval for freshness.[2]\n",
    "- **Caching Control**:\n",
    "  | Option | Behavior |\n",
    "  |--------|----------|\n",
    "  | Default `fetch` | Caches response; deduplicates same-URL calls [8] |\n",
    "  | `{ cache: 'no-store' }` | Disables cache; fetches fresh data every time (SSR-like) [1] |\n",
    "  | `{ tags: ['collection'] }` | Enables on-demand revalidation via `revalidateTag` [5] |\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Fetching posts from JSONPlaceholder API caches first load; `{ revalidate: 3600 }` updates hourly.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next.js Fetch API Specifics\n",
    "Next.js extends native `fetch` for optimization:\n",
    "- **Auto-caching**: GET requests cache by default; shared across users.[8]\n",
    "- **Exceptions**: No caching in Server Actions or Route Handlers (POST).[1]\n",
    "- Parallel fetching: Use `Promise.all` for independent requests to avoid sequential blocking.[8]\n",
    "- Deduplication: Same URL/options in one render combine into one request.[8]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example** (ISR fetch):\n",
    "```jsx\n",
    "const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts', {\n",
    "  next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Revalidate every hour\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exceptions and Best Practices\n",
    "- **Static by Default**: Next.js prefers SSG; opts into SSR only if dynamic APIs detected.[9][3]\n",
    "- **Streaming**: Use `loading.js` or `<Suspense>` for non-blocking UIs during fetches.[8]\n",
    "- Rule of Thumb: Use SSG/ISR for infrequent changes; SSR for real-time needs. Check docs for edge cases.[5][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Main Takeaways\n",
    "- **SSR**: Per-request rendering for dynamic data (`dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`).\n",
    "- **SSG**: Build-time static pages (default for static content).\n",
    "- **ISR**: Cached static with timed revalidation (`{ next: { revalidate: N } }`).\n",
