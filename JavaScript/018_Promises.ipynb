    "# JavaScript Promises \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript **Promises** provide a clean, powerful way to handle asynchronous code such as network calls, database queries, timers, and AJAX requests.[1]\n",
    "They help manage both the **result value** and the **completion state** (success or failure) of asynchronous operations in an organized, readable manner.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Promise?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Promise** is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (success or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.[1]\n",
    "Instead of returning a final value immediately, an asynchronous function returns a Promise, which will provide the value sometime in the future.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Roles of a Promise\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tracks whether an async operation is still running, has succeeded, or has failed.[1]\n",
    "- Stores the value produced on success, or the error produced on failure.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Promise States\n",
    "\n",
    "A Promise can be in exactly one of these states at a time:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pending**  \n",
    "  - Initial state when the async operation has started but not yet finished.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fulfilled (Resolved)**  \n",
    "  - The async operation completed successfully and a value is available.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rejected**  \n",
    "  - The async operation failed and an error reason is available.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a real-life promise:  \n",
    "- If you fulfill it → fulfilled/resolved.  \n",
    "- If you fail to do it → rejected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Promise and Asynchronous Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In synchronous code, a function runs immediately and returns a value on the spot.[1]\n",
    "In asynchronous code, the operation may take time (e.g., waiting for a server), but a Promise lets the function **still return something immediately**: the Promise object, which will later carry the real value when done.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Important idea:  \n",
    "- The async function does **not** return the final value immediately.  \n",
    "- It returns a Promise that will supply the value **at some point in the future** once the operation completes.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Promise\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic syntax to create a new Promise:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let firstPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n",
    "  // Your async (or sync) code here\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Promise constructor** takes a function called the *executor*.[1]\n",
    "- The executor receives two parameters:\n",
    "  - `resolve(value)` → mark the Promise as fulfilled and provide a value.  \n",
    "  - `reject(error)` → mark the Promise as rejected and provide an error.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example idea from the lecture:  \n",
    "- Initially log something synchronously inside the executor (e.g., a string), and log the Promise object to see it in the **pending** state until `resolve` or `reject` is called.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing Promise State: resolve and reject\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the Promise executor, you decide when to resolve or reject:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pending → Fulfilled**  \n",
    "  - Call `resolve(someValue)` when the operation succeeds.  \n",
    "  - The Promise’s state becomes fulfilled and its `value` property conceptually holds `someValue`.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pending → Rejected**  \n",
    "  - Call `reject(error)` when the operation fails.  \n",
    "  - The Promise’s state becomes rejected and carries the given error (often an `Error` object).[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example pattern illustrated in the lecture conceptually:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n",
    "  let success = true;\n",
    "  if (success) {\n",
    "    resolve(\"Promise fulfilled\");\n",
    "  } else {\n",
    "    reject(\"Promise rejected\");\n",
    "  }\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `success` is `true`, the Promise becomes fulfilled with the message.  \n",
    "- If `success` is `false`, the Promise becomes rejected with an error message.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Asynchronous Code Inside a Promise (setTimeout)\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture uses `setTimeout` as a concrete asynchronous example.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "setTimeout(function printName() {\n",
    "  console.log(\"My name is ...\");\n",
    "}, 10000); // runs after 10 seconds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `setTimeout` schedules the function to run after a delay, making this asynchronous.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding this inside a Promise executor lets you **wrap asynchronous behavior in a Promise**:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let firstPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n",
    "  setTimeout(() => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"My name is ...\");\n",
    "    resolve(1); // or resolve any value when done\n",
    "  }, 15000);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- While waiting for 15 seconds, logging the Promise shows it is in **pending** state.  \n",
    "- After `setTimeout` finishes and `resolve` is called, the Promise becomes **fulfilled** with the given value.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous code** runs sequentially, blocking until each operation finishes.[1]\n",
    "- **Asynchronous code** runs tasks in the background (e.g., timers, network requests) while other code continues, improving responsiveness and concurrency.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Promises help manage such background asynchronous tasks in a clean, debuggable way, especially for things like:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network calls (APIs)  \n",
    "- Database connections  \n",
    "- AJAX requests  \n",
    "- Timers  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## then() and catch()\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a Promise is created, it is consumed using **`then()`** and **`catch()`**.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### then()\n",
    "\n",
    "`then()` handles the **fulfilled** (resolved) case.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "promise.then((message) => {\n",
    "  console.log(\"then message is:\", message);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `then(callback)` is called when the Promise is fulfilled.  \n",
    "- The callback receives the resolved value as `message`.[1]\n",
    "- `then()` itself returns a **new Promise**, enabling chaining.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### catch()\n",
    "\n",
    "`catch()` handles the **rejected** case.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "promise.catch((error) => {\n",
    "  console.log(\"Error:\", error);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `catch(callback)` is called when the Promise is rejected.  \n",
    "- The callback receives the error.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical pattern combining both:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "promise\n",
    "  .then((message) => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"then message is:\", message);\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .catch((error) => {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Error:\", error);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior explained in the lecture:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the Promise is fulfilled, `then` runs and `catch` is skipped.  \n",
    "- If the Promise is rejected, `then` is skipped and `catch` runs with the error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Promise Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promise chaining** means using multiple `then()` calls one after another on the same Promise, where each `then()` can return a value that the next `then()` receives.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example pattern (conceptual):[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "promise\n",
    "  .then((msg) => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"First message:\", msg);\n",
    "    return \"Second message\";\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .then((msg) => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Second message:\", msg);\n",
    "    return \"Third message\";\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .then((msg) => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Third message:\", msg);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each `then()` can:\n",
    "  - Use the value from the previous `then()`.  \n",
    "  - Return a new value, which becomes the input to the next `then()`.  \n",
    "- This avoids deeply nested callbacks and leads to more readable “linear” async flows.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture also demonstrates chaining with different numeric values (like 10, 20, 30) to show how values pass through each `then()` sequentially.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Handling with catch() in Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "In a chain, a single `catch()` at the end can handle errors from any of the previous `then()` steps.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example pattern:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "promise\n",
    "  .then((msg) => {\n",
    "    // step 1\n",
    "    return \"next\";\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .then((msg) => {\n",
    "    // step 2\n",
    "    // could throw or return a rejected Promise\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .catch((error) => {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Caught error:\", error);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept from the lecture:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- If something fails (e.g., set `success = false` and `reject(\"Internal server error\")`), the Promise becomes rejected.  \n",
    "- The chain skips any `then()` and jumps directly to `catch()`, where the error message is logged.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## finally()\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`finally()`** method runs regardless of whether the Promise is fulfilled or rejected.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "promise\n",
    "  .then((msg) => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Success:\", msg);\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .catch((error) => {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Error:\", error);\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .finally(() => {\n",
    "    console.log(\"I will always run\");\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key behavior:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- `finally()` executes after the Promise settles (either fulfilled or rejected).  \n",
    "- It is useful for cleanup tasks like closing loaders, clearing timers, or releasing resources.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Multiple Promises Concurrently with Promise.all\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple asynchronous operations need to run in parallel and you want to wait for all of them, use **`Promise.all()`**.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating multiple Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture builds three Promises using `setTimeout`, each resolving after different delays:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n",
    "  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"First\"), 1000); // 1 second\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "let promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n",
    "  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"Second\"), 2000); // 2 seconds\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "let promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n",
    "  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"Third\"), 4000); // 4 seconds\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Promise.all()\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])\n",
    "  .then((values) => {\n",
    "    console.log(values); // e.g., [\"First\", \"Second\", \"Third\"]\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .catch((error) => {\n",
    "    console.error(\"Error:\", error);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Important points from the lecture:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Promise.all()` returns a new Promise.**  \n",
    "- This new Promise:\n",
    "  - Fulfills only when **all** Promises in the array are fulfilled.  \n",
    "  - Resolves with an array of all resolved values, in the **same order as the input array**, not in order of completion time.[1]\n",
    "- If **any one** of the Promises is rejected:\n",
    "  - The resulting Promise from `Promise.all()` is also rejected.  \n",
    "  - Execution jumps to the `catch()` handler with that error.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The order demonstration:  \n",
    "- Changing the order of `promise1`, `promise2`, `promise3` in the array changes the order of values in the `values` array, even though their completion times differ.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Promise**: Object representing future completion/failure of an async operation and its value.[1]\n",
    "- **Pending**: Initial state; operation not finished yet.[1]\n",
    "- **Fulfilled / Resolved**: Operation succeeded; value available.[1]\n",
    "- **Rejected**: Operation failed; error available.[1]\n",
    "- **resolve()**: Function to mark Promise fulfilled with a value.[1]\n",
    "- **reject()**: Function to mark Promise rejected with an error.[1]\n",
    "- **then()**: Method to handle success and chain further actions.[1]\n",
    "- **catch()**: Method to handle errors from Promise or previous `then()` handlers.[1]\n",
    "- **finally()**: Method that runs after fulfillment or rejection, for cleanup.[1]\n",
    "- **Promise chaining**: Using multiple `then()` calls, passing values from one to another.[1]\n",
    "- **Promise.all()**: Utility to run multiple Promises concurrently and wait for all to settle successfully, or fail fast if one rejects.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Main Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Promise** is an object that manages the result and state of asynchronous operations, with three core states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.[1]\n",
    "- Use **`resolve`** and **`reject`** inside the Promise executor to switch from pending to fulfilled or rejected, often wrapping asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, network calls, or database queries.[1]\n",
    "- Consume Promises using **`then()`** for success, **`catch()`** for errors, and **`finally()`** for logic that must always run, and use **Promise chaining** to sequence multiple async steps cleanly without callback hell.[1]\n",
    "- Use **`Promise.all()`** to handle multiple Promises concurrently, getting all results together if every Promise succeeds, or a single error if any one fails."
