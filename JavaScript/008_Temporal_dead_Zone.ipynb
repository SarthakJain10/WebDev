    "# JavaScript Variable Scoping and Temporal Dead Zone \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture explains **how variables behave in different scopes** in JavaScript and introduces the concept of the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.\n",
    "It focuses on how `var`, `let`, and `const` differ in **global, function, and block scope**, and why `let`/`const` are preferred in modern JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Scoping Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope** defines *where* in the code a variable can be accessed.[1]\n",
    "In JavaScript, the lecture discusses three main scopes: **global scope**, **function scope**, and **block scope**, across the three declaration keywords: `var`, `let`, and `const`.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:[1]\n",
    "- `var` is **function scoped** and **not block scoped**.  \n",
    "- `let` and `const` are **block scoped**.  \n",
    "- All three can exist in global scope, but using too many globals is discouraged.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is in **global scope** if it is declared directly in the file, not inside any function, block, loop, or conditional.[1]\n",
    "Its “parent” is effectively the whole file, so it is accessible everywhere in that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example idea (not from the transcript, but consistent with it):  \n",
    "```js\n",
    "var age = 15;   // Global scope\n",
    "```\n",
    "This `age` is not wrapped in any `{}` or function, so it is global.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior of `var`, `let`, `const` in Global Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable is declared in the global scope with `var`, `let`, or `const`, it can be accessed:[1]\n",
    "- Inside any `if` statement.  \n",
    "- Inside any loop (`for`, `while` etc.).  \n",
    "- Inside any function.  \n",
    "- Inside any other block (`{}`) in the same file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the lecture’s examples: a globally declared variable (e.g., `age`) worked correctly when accessed:[1]\n",
    "- Directly in the file.  \n",
    "- Inside blocks `{}`.  \n",
    "- Inside an `if` condition.  \n",
    "- Inside a `for` loop.  \n",
    "- Inside a function that printed its value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Global Variables Are Discouraged\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can be **accessed and modified from anywhere**, making the code **harder to debug**.[1]\n",
    "- They reduce **predictability**, as it becomes unclear which part of the code changed the value.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practice:** Keep global variables to a minimum; prefer local (function/block) scoped variables.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is **function scoped** if it is declared *inside* a function using `var`, `let`, or `const`.\n",
    "Such a variable is accessible **only within that function’s curly braces** `{}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example idea (aligned with lecture):  \n",
    "```js\n",
    "function sayHello() {\n",
    "  var fullName = \"Earth\";\n",
    "  console.log(\"Hello duniya\", fullName);\n",
    "}\n",
    "sayHello();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Inside `sayHello`, `fullName` can be used and prints correctly, but accessing `fullName` **outside** the function gives an error like “`fullName` is not defined”.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Same Behavior for `var`, `let`, `const` Inside Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture shows that if you declare a variable inside a function:\n",
    "- Using `var` – accessible only inside that function.  \n",
    "- Using `let` – same rule.  \n",
    "- Using `const` – same rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In all three cases, the variable **cannot** be accessed outside the function; trying to do so results in a reference error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways for Function Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anything declared inside a function **lives and dies** with that function’s execution context.  \n",
    "- After the function’s block ends (`}`), those variables are no longer accessible.\n",
    "- This encapsulation is good for organizing code and avoiding unwanted name clashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is a Block?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **block** is any code enclosed in `{}` such as:\n",
    "- A standalone block: `{ ... }`  \n",
    "- An `if` statement block  \n",
    "- A loop body: `for (...) { ... }`  \n",
    "- Blocks used for grouping code  \n",
    "\n",
    "### `var` in Block Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture stresses that **`var` is *not* block scoped**.\n",
    "Example idea:  \n",
    "```js\n",
    "{\n",
    "  var height = 180;\n",
    "}\n",
    "console.log(height); // This still works with var\n",
    "```\n",
    "Even though `height` is declared inside a block, it remains accessible **outside** that block when declared with `var`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructor also notes that if code is run *above* the block, `var` is hoisted, so the declaration exists but the **value** is `undefined` until assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hoisting and `var` Inside Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "- With `var`, **declaration** is hoisted to the top of the current function/global scope.\n",
    "- **Value** is not hoisted; before assignment the value is `undefined`.\n",
    "- This allows accessing the variable before the line where it is written, but the result is `undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `let` and `const` in Block Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture highlights that `let` and `const` **are block scoped**:\n",
    "- A variable declared with `let`/`const` inside `{}` is only accessible **inside that block**.  \n",
    "- Trying to access it outside the block results in an error.\n",
    "Example idea:  \n",
    "```js\n",
    "{\n",
    "  let score = 100;\n",
    "}\n",
    "console.log(score); // Error: score is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "- `var` declared in a block → can be accessed outside the block (not block scoped).  \n",
    "- `let`/`const` declared in a block → cannot be accessed outside that block (block scoped).  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Scope Behavior of `var`, `let`, `const`\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scope Type     | `var` behavior                                    | `let` behavior                              | `const` behavior                            |  \n",
    "|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  \n",
    "| Global scope   | Accessible anywhere in the file. [1]          | Accessible anywhere in the file. [1]    | Accessible anywhere in the file. [1]    |  \n",
    "| Function scope | Accessible only inside the function. [1]      | Accessible only inside the function. [1]| Accessible only inside the function. [1]|  \n",
    "| Block scope    | Not block scoped; accessible outside block. [1]| Block scoped; only inside that block. [1]| Block scoped; only inside that block. [1]|\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture repeatedly emphasizes that this is why `let`/`const` are described as **block scoped**, while `var` is not.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **Temporal Dead Zone** is introduced after revisiting **hoisting**.[1]\n",
    "Students are expected to already know that `var` declarations are hoisted, and that `let`/`const` are handled differently during hoisting.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is the Temporal Dead Zone?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a variable declared with `let` or `const`, there is a region of code **between the start of the scope and the line where the variable is declared** where:[1]\n",
    "- The variable **exists in memory**, but  \n",
    "- Accessing it results in a **runtime error**, not `undefined`.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This region is called the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual example (aligned with lecture logic):  \n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(marks); // Error (TDZ)\n",
    "let marks = 100;\n",
    "console.log(marks); // 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, from the beginning of the scope up to the declaration line of `marks`, is its TDZ.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior with `let`/`const`\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture uses an example where `let marks = 100;` is declared, and accessing `marks` **after** the declaration works fine.[1]\n",
    "When the code is modified to access `marks` **before** the `let` line, an **error** appears (not `undefined`), demonstrating TDZ.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties:[1]\n",
    "- `let` and `const` declarations are **not hoisted in the usable sense** like `var`; their declaration is noted at the start of scope, but they cannot be accessed until execution reaches the declaration line.  \n",
    "- Any access before that line (within the same scope) is inside the **Temporal Dead Zone**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference from `var`\n",
    "\n",
    "- With `var`, accessing a variable before its declaration returns `undefined` due to hoisting of the declaration.[1]\n",
    "- With `let`/`const`, accessing before the declaration throws an error because of TDZ.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference makes code with `let`/`const` safer and more predictable, as it avoids subtle bugs caused by `undefined` values from hoisting.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices from the Lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructor strongly recommends:[1]\n",
    "- **Avoid using `var`** as much as possible.  \n",
    "- Prefer **`let` and `const`** for declaring variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons:[1]\n",
    "- `let`/`const` respect block scope, which keeps code more modular and easier to reason about.  \n",
    "- TDZ behavior makes invalid early access fail loudly with an error instead of silently giving `undefined`, making debugging easier.  \n",
    "- Overall, code becomes more **predictable** and **safe**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Condensed Summary / Revision Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scope** controls where a variable is accessible: global, function, and block.[1]\n",
    "- In **global scope**, variables declared with `var`, `let`, or `const` are accessible anywhere in the file, but heavy use of globals is discouraged due to debugging and predictability issues.[1]\n",
    "- In **function scope**, any variable (`var`/`let`/`const`) declared inside a function is usable only within that function; outside access causes a reference error.[1]\n",
    "- In **block scope**, `var` is *not* block scoped (it leaks outside the block), but `let` and `const` are block scoped and cannot be accessed outside their `{}`.[1]\n",
    "- **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** is the region between the start of a scope and the `let`/`const` declaration line where the variable exists but cannot be accessed; accessing it there throws an error, not `undefined`.[1]\n",
    "- `var` is hoisted with value `undefined`, whereas `let`/`const` are restricted by TDZ, making `let`/`const` safer and preferred in modern JavaScript."
