    "# JavaScript Functions: Plain, Arrow, and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Functions and Why Use Them?\n",
    "Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks, eliminating code duplication and improving modularity. They solve problems like repeating console.log statements multiple times, which leads to bulky, hard-to-maintain code with poor readability. By grouping related statements into a function, code becomes reusable, easier to debug (changes in one place affect all calls), and more efficient.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions differ from loops: loops repeat the same code block continuously without external triggers, while functions execute only when explicitly called for on-demand tasks.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Function Syntax and Calling\n",
    "**Function Declaration** uses the `function` keyword followed by a name, parameters in parentheses, and a body in curly braces:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function myName() {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Love Babbar\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "myName(); // Function call with parentheses\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function must be **called** (invoked) to execute; defining it alone does nothing. Without a call, no output occurs.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters** (defined in function) receive **arguments** (values passed during call):\n",
    "```\n",
    "function printNumber(num) {  // 'num' is parameter\n",
    "    console.log(num);\n",
    "}\n",
    "printNumber(5);  // 5 is argument\n",
    "```\n",
    "Multiple parameters work similarly, e.g., for calculating average:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function getAverage(num1, num2) {\n",
    "    let avg = (num1 + num2) / 2;\n",
    "    console.log(avg);\n",
    "}\n",
    "getAverage(3, 7);  // Outputs 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return Statements\n",
    "Functions can **return** values using the `return` keyword, sending output back to the caller for storage or use:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function getSum(a, b, c) {\n",
    "    let sum = a + b + c;\n",
    "    return sum;  // Returns value; code below is unreachable\n",
    "}\n",
    "let answer = getSum(1, 2, 3);  // Stores 6 in 'answer'\n",
    "console.log(answer);  // 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unreachable code after `return` never executes, shown as \"Unreachable Code\" in editors. JavaScript handles type coercion flexibly, e.g., `7 + \" Babbar\"` becomes `\"7 Babbar\"`.[4][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Types\n",
    "### Function Declaration\n",
    "Standalone, hoisted (usable before definition):\n",
    "```\n",
    "function greet() {\n",
    "    return \"Hello\";\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Function Expression\n",
    "Assigns function to a variable; executes only after definition (no hoisting for the variable):\n",
    "```\n",
    "const greet = function() {\n",
    "    return \"Hello\";\n",
    "};\n",
    "console.log(greet());  // Works after assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use `const` for immutability.[5][3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrow Functions (ES6+)\n",
    "Concise syntax replacing `function` with `=>`; preferred for modern code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const getPower = (x, y) => Math.pow(x, y);\n",
    "console.log(getPower(2, 10));  // 1024\n",
    "```\n",
    "Shorter for single expressions (implicit return); no separate `return` or braces needed. Arrow functions lack their own `this` binding, `arguments` object, and can't be constructors—ideal for callbacks but not object methods.[6][7][8][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Declaration | Expression | Arrow |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|------------|-------|\n",
    "| Syntax | `function name() {}` | `const name = function() {}` | `const name = () => {}` |\n",
    "| Hoisting | Yes (whole function) | No (variable only) | No |\n",
    "| `this` Binding | Dynamic | Dynamic | Lexical (inherits from parent) |\n",
    "| Use Case | Named, reusable | Assigned to variables | Concise callbacks [3][9] |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "Functions promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code by encapsulating tasks, supporting parameters/arguments for flexibility and `return` for output. Master declaration for hoisting, expressions for assignments, and arrows for brevity—use arrows predominantly in modern JS. Always call functions and handle returns properly; avoid unreachable code. Practice with examples like sums, averages, and powers for proficiency."
