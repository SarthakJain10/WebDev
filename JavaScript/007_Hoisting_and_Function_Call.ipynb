    "# JavaScript Hoisting, Call Stack & First-Class Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Hoisting?\n",
    "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their current scope during the compilation phase before code execution. This process creates the appearance that declarations are \"lifted\" to the top, allowing access before their written position in the code. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations, which explains why undeclared variables often output `undefined` rather than throwing errors.[1][2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Benefit**: Enables flexible code ordering, like calling functions before their definition.\n",
    "- **Scope**: Applies within the current block, function, or global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Hoisting\n",
    "Variables declared with `var` are hoisted with their declaration but initialized as `undefined`. Modern `let` and `const` are also hoisted but remain in a \"temporal dead zone\" (TDZ), causing a ReferenceError if accessed before initialization.[4][5][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "console.log(age);  // undefined\n",
    "var age = 25;\n",
    "console.log(age);  // 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Equivalent after hoisting**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var age;           // Hoisted declaration\n",
    "console.log(age);  // undefined\n",
    "age = 25;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "console.log(age);  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization\n",
    "let age = 25;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`var`**: Hoists declaration only; value assignment stays in place.[2]\n",
    "- **`let`/`const`**: Hoisted but inaccessible until initialized (no `undefined`).[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice**: Prefer `let`/`const` for predictable behavior and to avoid hoisting surprises.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Hoisting\n",
    "Function declarations are fully hoisted, including the entire function body, allowing calls before the definition. Function expressions (assigned to variables) behave like variables: only the variable declaration hoists.[6][7][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "sayName(\"Babbar\");  // Works: \"My name is Babbar\"\n",
    "function sayName(name) {\n",
    "  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sayHello();         // ReferenceError\n",
    "const sayHello = function() {\n",
    "  console.log(\"Hello\");\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Function Declaration**: Entire function moves to top of scope.[6]\n",
    "- **Function Expression**: Treated as variable; no full hoisting.[8]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes**: Not hoisted; accessing before declaration throws ReferenceError.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Call Stack\n",
    "The call stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure that tracks function execution order in JavaScript's single-threaded environment. Each function call pushes a new execution context onto the stack; completion \"pops\" it, returning to the caller.[9][10][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. Global execution context pushed first.\n",
    "2. Function call → New context pushed (e.g., `a()` calls `b()` → stack: [global, a, b]).\n",
    "3. Function ends → Context popped (LIFO returns to previous).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nested Example**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function a() { console.log(\"a\"); b(); }\n",
    "function b() { console.log(\"b\"); c(); }\n",
    "function c() { console.log(\"c\"); }\n",
    "a();  // Output: a → b → c (stack grows then shrinks)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Stack trace on errors reveals this order.[10]\n",
    "\n",
    "## First-Class Functions (Citizens)\n",
    "JavaScript treats functions as **first-class citizens**, meaning they behave like any value: assignable to variables, passed as arguments, returned from functions, stored in data structures, or used as object properties.[11][12][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstrations\n",
    "- **Assign to Variable**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  const greet = function() { console.log(\"Hello\"); };\n",
    "  greet();  // Hello\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Pass as Argument**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  function greetMe(fn, name) {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Hello \" + name);\n",
    "    fn();\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  function sayDay() { console.log(\"Good day\"); }\n",
    "  greetMe(sayDay, \"Babbar\");  // Hello Babbar → Good day\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Return Function**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  function solver(n) {\n",
    "    return function(num) { return num * n; };\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  const multiplyBy5 = solver(5);\n",
    "  console.log(multiplyBy5(10));  // 50\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **In Arrays/Objects**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  const ops = [\n",
    "    (a, b) => a + b,\n",
    "    (a, b) => a - b\n",
    "  ];\n",
    "  console.log(ops[0](5, 10));  // 15\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Hoisting moves declarations to scope tops (`var` → `undefined`; functions fully hoisted; `let`/`const` in TDZ). Call stack manages LIFO execution for nested functions. Functions as first-class citizens enable powerful patterns like callbacks and higher-order functions. Use `let`/`const`, declare before use, and understand stack traces for debugging. These concepts are essential for interviews and avoiding common pitfalls."
