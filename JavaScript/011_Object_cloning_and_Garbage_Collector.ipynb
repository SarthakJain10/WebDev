    "# JavaScript Object Cloning and Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamic Nature of Objects\n",
    "JavaScript objects exhibit a **dynamic nature**, allowing properties to be added, modified, or removed at runtime without predefined structures. This flexibility enables runtime changes to object state, distinguishing JavaScript from more rigid languages. For instance, starting with an object `{ age: 12, weight: 68, height: \"180cm\" }`, a new property like `color: \"white\"` can be added directly via `obj.color = \"white\"`, and it appears when the object is logged.[1][2][3][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Benefit**: Supports adaptable code but requires caution to prevent unintended mutations.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  let obj = { age: 12, weight: 68 };\n",
    "  obj.color = \"white\";  // New property added dynamically\n",
    "  console.log(obj);     // { age: 12, weight: 68, color: \"white\" }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Cloning Fundamentals\n",
    "Cloning creates an independent copy of an object, distinct from **reference copying** (e.g., `let b = a`), where both variables point to the same memory location. Changes to one affect the other since no new object is created. True cloning produces separate objects with identical content initially; verifying involves modifying the source and checking if the clone remains unchanged.[5][6][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference Copy Issue**:\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  let source = { age: 12 };\n",
    "  let dest = source;     // Reference copy\n",
    "  source.age = 90;\n",
    "  console.log(dest.age); // 90 (mutated)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Shallow vs. Deep Clone**: Covered methods create **shallow clones** (nested objects copied by reference); deep cloning for nested structures requires additional handling.[7][6]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloning Methods\n",
    "Three primary methods for shallow cloning are demonstrated, prioritizing modern approaches over manual iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Spread Operator (`...`)\n",
    "The most concise ES6 method spreads source properties into a new object.[8][5]\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let source = { age: 12, weight: 68 };\n",
    "let dest = { ...source };\n",
    "source.age = 90;\n",
    "console.log(dest.age);  // 12 (independent)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Supports multiple sources: `{ ...source1, ...source2 }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Object.assign()\n",
    "Copies enumerable own properties from sources to a target object; pass `{}` as target for cloning.[9][10]\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let source = { age: 12 };\n",
    "let dest = Object.assign({}, source);\n",
    "source.age = 90;\n",
    "console.log(dest.age);  // 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Merges multiple sources: `Object.assign({}, source1, source2)`.\n",
    "- Triggers setters unlike spread.[11]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. For...in Loop (Manual Iteration)\n",
    "Iterates keys and copies key-value pairs; suitable for simple cases but verbose and error-prone for nested objects.[1]\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let source = { age: 12, weight: 68 };\n",
    "let dest = {};\n",
    "for (let key in source) {\n",
    "  dest[key] = source[key];\n",
    "}\n",
    "source.age = 90;\n",
    "console.log(dest.age);  // 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Drawback**: Challenging with nested objects; prefer spread or `Object.assign()`.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method          | Syntax Example                  | Multiple Sources | Triggers Setters | Best For          |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Spread (`...`) | `{ ...source }`                | Yes             | No               | Concise new objects [7] |\n",
    "| Object.assign()| `Object.assign({}, source)`    | Yes             | Yes              | Merging properties [9] |\n",
    "| For...in Loop  | Manual key-value copy          | Manual          | N/A              | Learning basics [1] |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Garbage Collection (GC)\n",
    "JavaScript employs automatic **Garbage Collection** to reclaim memory from unreachable objects, unlike manual management in C/C++ (e.g., `new`/`delete`). GC runs in the background without developer control, identifying and freeing unused memory to boost performance and prevent **memory leaks** (allocated memory no longer in use but not freed).[12][13][14]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Process (Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm)**: Starts from roots (global objects, active functions), marks reachable objects, then sweeps unmarked ones.[12][1]\n",
    "- **No Direct Control**: Developers cannot invoke GC manually; it operates autonomously.[15]\n",
    "- **Benefits**:\n",
    "  - Frees unused memory automatically.\n",
    "  - Reduces memory leaks and improves app efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This lecture covers JavaScript objects' dynamic properties, three cloning techniques (spread operator, Object.assign(), for...in), and automatic garbage collection for memory management. Prefer spread or Object.assign() for cloning to avoid reference pitfalls; understand GC prevents manual memory handling. Practice verifying clones by mutation tests for mastery."
