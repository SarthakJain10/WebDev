    "# JavaScript Event Loop \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topic: Understanding the **JavaScript Event Loop**, its need, and how it handles **synchronous** and **asynchronous** code using the **call stack**, **browser APIs**, and **callback queue**.[1]\n",
    "- Goal: Explain how JavaScript, despite being **single-threaded**, can handle asynchronous operations (timers, events, network calls) without blocking the main thread.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronous Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Synchronous code is executed **immediately and in order** as soon as the execution flow reaches a line; it does not make you wait. Each line completes before the next one starts.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example idea:**  \n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(\"Hi\");\n",
    "console.log(\"Love\");\n",
    "console.log(\"Babbar\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "- When execution reaches each line, the message is printed **on the spot**.\n",
    "- There is no delay; the behavior is guaranteed as soon as execution hits that line.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Executes **line by line** in sequence.\n",
    "- No waiting for external operations.\n",
    "- The result appears immediately once the line is reached.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Asynchronous code is code whose behavior does **not** necessarily happen at the exact moment the execution flow reaches that line. Execution proceeds ahead, and the result may appear **later** (not guaranteed at a fixed time).[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `setTimeout`  \n",
    "- Event listeners (e.g., `onclick`)  \n",
    "- Network requests (AJAX/fetch)  \n",
    "- Database connection requests[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example idea (setTimeout):**\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function sayMyName() {\n",
    "  console.log(\"Love Babbar\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "setTimeout(sayMyName, 5000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Execution reaches `setTimeout`, but `\"Love Babbar\"` is **not** printed immediately.[1]\n",
    "- Even with `5000` ms delay, there is **no strict guarantee** that it will run *exactly* after 5 seconds; it may be later (e.g., 10s, 25s), depending on whether the main thread is free.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The execution reaches the asynchronous line, but the effect (callback execution) happens **later**.\n",
    "- The time delay given (like 5000 ms) is the **earliest** time after which the callback becomes **eligible** to run, not a guarantee it will run exactly then.[1]\n",
    "- Used heavily for:\n",
    "  - Timers  \n",
    "  - UI events  \n",
    "  - Network I/O  \n",
    "  - DB operations[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Asynchronous Code Is Needed (Blocking Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocking** happens when a piece of code prevents the rest of the program from executing until it finishes, causing everything below it to wait.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thought experiment (no async, everything synchronous):**\n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(\"Start\");\n",
    "// Some long network request\n",
    "console.log(\"End\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If the network call is synchronous:\n",
    "  - `\"Start\"` prints.[1]\n",
    "  - Execution reaches the network call and **waits** until response comes.\n",
    "  - `\"End\"` is blocked until that response arrives.[1]\n",
    "- All code below is stuck; the main thread is **blocked**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real applications (e.g., front-end web apps):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blocking the main thread means the page becomes **unresponsive**.\n",
    "- UI cannot update, user cannot interact smoothly.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Need for Asynchronous Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid blocking:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long or uncertain operations (network calls, timers, DB calls, listeners) are handled **off the main thread** using browser capabilities and event loop mechanisms.[1]\n",
    "- JavaScript remains **single-threaded**, but asynchronous handling plus the event loop gives **concurrency-like behavior** without blocking the main thread.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components of the Event Loop Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture focuses on three key components:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Call Stack**\n",
    "2. **Browser (Web APIs)**\n",
    "3. **Callback Queue** (also called **Task Queue**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Call Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structure where JavaScript tracks **function calls**.\n",
    "- When a function is called, an entry (stack frame) is **pushed** onto the stack.[1]\n",
    "- When the function finishes, its entry is **popped** from the stack.[1]\n",
    "- All **synchronous code** is handled directly via the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Browser (Web APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The browser environment provides features like:\n",
    "  - `setTimeout`\n",
    "  - DOM events (click, keypress)\n",
    "  - Network requests (XHR, fetch)\n",
    "- When asynchronous functions are used, the **work and timers** are handled by the browser, **not** by the JavaScript engine itself.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Callback Queue (Task Queue)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A queue where **ready-to-run callbacks** are placed after their timer or event completes.[1]\n",
    "- Callbacks are added to the **front/back** of this queue as they become eligible (e.g., after timeout completes or event triggers).[1]\n",
    "- They **do not** run immediately; they must be moved from the callback queue to the call stack by the **event loop**.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Event Loop Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event Loop Role:**  \n",
    "The event loop constantly checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the **call stack empty**?  \n",
    "2. If yes, is there any callback waiting in the **callback queue**?  \n",
    "3. If both conditions match, it **moves** the front callback from the queue to the call stack for execution.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synchronous code is run first on the call stack.[1]\n",
    "- Asynchronous callbacks wait in the callback queue until:\n",
    "  - Their condition is ready (timer done or event fired), and\n",
    "  - The call stack is empty.[1]\n",
    "- Event loop then transfers callbacks to the call stack one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Simple setTimeout Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this conceptual code:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(\"Hi\");\n",
    "\n",
    "setTimeout(sayMyName, 5000);\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(\"End\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step behavior:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execution reaches `console.log(\"Hi\")`:\n",
    "   - Entry added to call stack.\n",
    "   - `\"Hi\"` is printed immediately.\n",
    "   - Entry removed from call stack.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Execution reaches `setTimeout(sayMyName, 5000)`:\n",
    "   - A frame for `setTimeout` is pushed onto the call stack.[1]\n",
    "   - Because `setTimeout` is asynchronous and supported by the browser:\n",
    "     - The timer and callback (`sayMyName`) are **handed over** to the browser.\n",
    "     - The 5000 ms timer starts in browser APIs.\n",
    "     - The `setTimeout` frame is popped off the call stack.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Execution reaches `console.log(\"End\")`:\n",
    "   - Entry added to call stack.\n",
    "   - `\"End\"` is printed immediately.\n",
    "   - Entry removed; call stack now empty.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After at least 5000 ms:\n",
    "   - Browser timer completes.\n",
    "   - The callback `sayMyName` is placed into the **callback queue**.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Event loop:\n",
    "   - Sees the call stack is empty and callback queue has `sayMyName`.\n",
    "   - Moves `sayMyName` from callback queue to call stack.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `sayMyName` executes:\n",
    "   - Inside, it calls `console.log(\"Love Babbar\")`.\n",
    "   - `\"Love Babbar\"` prints.\n",
    "   - Function completes and is popped from the stack.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The callback does **not** run exactly at 5000 ms; it runs after 5000 ms **and** when the call stack is empty.[1]\n",
    "- This mechanism prevents blocking and allows other synchronous code to run first.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2: Multiple Synchronous + Asynchronous Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual pattern from the lecture (names changed for clarity):[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(\"Love\");     // synchronous\n",
    "console.log(\"Babbar\");   // synchronous\n",
    "\n",
    "setTimeout(sayMyName, 3000);  // asynchronous\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(\"Manish\");   // synchronous\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution sequence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `console.log(\"Love\")`:\n",
    "   - Synchronous; directly prints `\"Love\"`, stack then cleared.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `console.log(\"Babbar\")`:\n",
    "   - Synchronous; directly prints `\"Babbar\"`, stack then cleared.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `setTimeout(sayMyName, 3000)`:\n",
    "   - Handed over to browser; 3000 ms timer starts.\n",
    "   - No blocking of main thread.\n",
    "   - Stack frame removed.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `console.log(\"Manish\")`:\n",
    "   - Synchronous; directly prints `\"Manish\"` while the 3-second timer is still running in the browser.\n",
    "   - Stack cleared.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After timer completes:\n",
    "   - `sayMyName` is added to **callback queue**.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Event loop:\n",
    "   - Call stack is empty.\n",
    "   - Moves `sayMyName` from callback queue to call stack.\n",
    "   - Inside `sayMyName`, `\"Love Babbar\"` is logged synchronously.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observed order in console:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Love`  \n",
    "- `Babbar`  \n",
    "- `Manish`  \n",
    "- `Love Babbar` (from the async callback)[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All synchronous code runs **first**, in order.\n",
    "- Asynchronous code waits until:\n",
    "  - Its condition is ready (timer done), and\n",
    "  - Stack is free.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3: Event Listeners and Timers Together\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture also demonstrates a case with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **button click handler** (asynchronous event).[1]\n",
    "- A `setTimeout` with 5000 ms delay.[1]\n",
    "- Some synchronous console logs.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lines 5–7: async code related to a button click listener (on clicking, some function should run).[1]\n",
    "- Line 9: synchronous `console.log(\"Hi\")`, runs immediately.[1]\n",
    "- Line 11: `setTimeout` to run a function after 5000 ms (asynchronously).[1]\n",
    "- Line 15: synchronous log like `\"Welcome to loop\"`, runs immediately.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **event listener setup** is itself handled such that when a click happens, the callback goes to the **callback queue**, not directly to the stack.[1]\n",
    "2. When the button is clicked:\n",
    "   - The click event’s callback is enqueued in the callback queue.[1]\n",
    "   - Event loop then moves it to the call stack when it becomes empty, and it executes (e.g., printing `\"You clicked the button\"`).[1]\n",
    "3. Meanwhile, the timer set by `setTimeout` also follows the same pattern:  \n",
    "   - Timer completes → callback goes to callback queue → event loop moves it to call stack when stack is empty.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates that **multiple asynchronous sources** (timers, events) all funnel their callbacks into the **callback queue**, and the event loop coordinates their execution, always respecting that synchronous stack work completes first.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Event Loop Prevents Blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Asynchronous operations (timers, events, network calls) are **offloaded** to the browser, so the JavaScript engine does not block while waiting.[1]\n",
    "- The event loop ensures:\n",
    "  - **All synchronous code** in the call stack completes first.\n",
    "  - Then callbacks from the callback queue are executed one by one when the stack is empty.[1]\n",
    "- This avoids blocking on operations whose completion time is **uncertain** (network latency, user interaction), while keeping JavaScript **single-threaded**.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms (Quick Reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous code:** Code that executes immediately when reached; no waiting, runs in order on the call stack.[1]\n",
    "- **Asynchronous code:** Code whose effect is delayed; uses browser APIs and callbacks (e.g., `setTimeout`, event listeners, network calls).[1]\n",
    "- **Blocking:** Situation where code prevents further execution until it finishes, causing everything after it to wait.[1]\n",
    "- **Call Stack:** Data structure where JavaScript tracks active function calls and executes synchronous code.[1]\n",
    "- **Browser/Web APIs:** Environment provided by the browser to handle timers, events, and network operations.[1]\n",
    "- **Callback Queue (Task Queue):** Queue where ready callbacks wait for execution after timers/events complete.[1]\n",
    "- **Event Loop:** Mechanism that repeatedly checks if the call stack is empty and, if so, moves callbacks from the callback queue to the stack for execution.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Main Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- JavaScript is **single-threaded**, but still handles **asynchronous behavior** using the event loop model.[1]\n",
    "- **Synchronous code** executes immediately on the call stack, while **asynchronous operations** are delegated to browser APIs and later return callbacks via the **callback queue**.[1]\n",
    "- The **event loop** coordinates this by moving callbacks from the queue to the stack **only when the stack is empty**, ensuring all synchronous code finishes first.[1]\n",
    "- This design prevents **blocking**, keeps the UI responsive, and allows JavaScript to manage concurrency-like behavior in a single thread."
