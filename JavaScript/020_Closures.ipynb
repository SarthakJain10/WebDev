    "# Closures in JavaScript \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- This lecture explains the concept of **closures in JavaScript** using MDN-style definitions, diagrams, and step-by-step code execution.   \n",
    "- It builds from variable scoping and nested functions to show how a function can remember and access data from its outer scope even after that outer function has finished executing.   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Closure?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal idea\n",
    "\n",
    "- A closure is described as the **combination of a function and its surrounding state (lexical environment)**.   \n",
    "- In simpler terms, a closure **gives a function access to its outer scope** even after that outer function has executed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Desi definition (required data)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the lecture, the outer scope data is called the function’s **required data**.   \n",
    "- When you **bind a function together with all the data it needs from outside (required data)**, that package is called a closure.   \n",
    "- The same “required data” is also referred to as:\n",
    "  - **Lexical scope**\n",
    "  - **Surrounding state**   \n",
    "\n",
    "Key point:  \n",
    "> Closure = function + its required data (lexical scope / surrounding state).   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisite: Scope and Lifetime of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### let and block scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- `let` variables are **block scoped**, meaning they exist only between the pair of curly braces `{ ... }` where they are defined.   \n",
    "- When the closing brace of that block is reached, that `let` variable’s memory is **freed** and it is no longer accessible.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Example idea (from lecture’s explanation):   \n",
    "- Different `let name = ...` declarations are created in different blocks.  \n",
    "- For a `console.log(name)` inside some block:\n",
    "  - The JavaScript engine looks for the **nearest `name` in the current or outer scopes**.\n",
    "  - If a closer `name` exists in an inner block, that one is used.\n",
    "  - If only an outer one exists, that is used.\n",
    "  - If the variable is declared inside a smaller inner block and the log is outside that block, that inner `name` is **not accessible** because its block has ended.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding lifetime\n",
    "\n",
    "- The lecture reinforces the idea: **once control leaves a block**, all `let` variables defined only inside that block are expected to be destroyed and their memory freed.   \n",
    "- This intuition sets up the “puzzle” for closures: how can a function still access a variable after its defining block has supposedly finished?   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Functions: Outer and Inner\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic nested function flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual structure:   \n",
    "```js\n",
    "function outer() {\n",
    "  let value = 5;\n",
    "  function inner() {\n",
    "    console.log(value);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  inner();\n",
    "}\n",
    "outer();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution idea (as described in lecture):   \n",
    "- `outer` is defined from its opening to closing brace.  \n",
    "- When `outer()` is called:\n",
    "  - `value` is initialized to `5`.  \n",
    "  - `inner` function body is defined but not executed until called.  \n",
    "  - When `inner()` is called inside `outer`, execution enters `inner` and prints `value` (which is `5`).  \n",
    "  - When `inner` finishes, control returns to `outer`, and when `outer` finishes, control returns to the point where `outer()` was called.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key learning:  \n",
    "- A **nested (inner) function can directly use variables from its outer function** because of lexical scoping.   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Closure Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture asks a critical question:   \n",
    "- Suppose there is an outer function with a `let` variable inside it.  \n",
    "- The function executes completely and returns.  \n",
    "- Intuitively, the variable’s scope is only inside that function block, so **after the function finishes, that variable should be destroyed**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine:   \n",
    "- The inner function uses that variable.  \n",
    "- The outer function has already finished.  \n",
    "- Later, the inner function is called **from outside**.  \n",
    "- Question: **Should it throw an error because the variable no longer exists, or should it still print the value?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly where **closures** come into play.   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Closure Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual example from the lecture:   \n",
    "```js\n",
    "function outer() {\n",
    "  let name = \"Babbar\";\n",
    "  function inner() {\n",
    "    console.log(name);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  return inner;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const innerRef = outer();  // outer executes and returns inner\n",
    "innerRef();                // call inner later\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step execution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function definition**  \n",
    "   - `outer` is defined; inside it, `name` and `inner` are defined.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calling `outer()`**  \n",
    "   - Control enters the `outer` function body.  \n",
    "   - `let name = \"Babbar\";` is executed, so `name` now exists with value `\"Babbar\"`.   \n",
    "   - The `inner` function body is read; no execution yet.  \n",
    "   - `outer` **returns the reference of `inner`**, not its result.   \n",
    "   - So `innerRef` now holds a **function reference** to `inner`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **After `outer` finishes**  \n",
    "   - Intuitively, since `outer`’s block has completed, the `name` variable should be cleaned up and its memory freed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calling `innerRef()`**  \n",
    "   - When `innerRef()` is called, it effectively calls the original `inner` function.   \n",
    "   - Inside `inner`, there is `console.log(name)`.  \n",
    "   - Even though `outer` has finished, **`name` is still accessible**, and `\"Babbar\"` is printed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Observation:  \n",
    "- This behavior contradicts the simple scoping intuition that `name` should have been destroyed after `outer` finished.   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Actually Happens: Closure Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binding required data\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the nested function scenario, the inner function does not just store its code.  \n",
    "- The inner function is **bundled with a reference to its required outer variables** (like `name`).   \n",
    "- When `outer` returns `inner`, it effectively returns **a function + references to the data it needs**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Key details from the lecture:   \n",
    "- No **new copy** of the variable is made.  \n",
    "- The **same original variable’s reference** is attached (bound) with the inner function.  \n",
    "- Because of this binding, the variable’s memory is **not freed** as long as that inner function (closure) can still be called.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal closure statement\n",
    "\n",
    "- A closure is present when:\n",
    "  - There is an **inner function**.  \n",
    "  - That inner function **uses variables from its outer function**.  \n",
    "  - The inner function is **returned or passed around**, so it can be called **after** the outer function has finished.   \n",
    "- In such cases, JavaScript keeps the **lexical environment (required data) alive** for that inner function.   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Properties and Clarifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference, not copy\n",
    "\n",
    "- The required data is **not cloned**; instead, **references** to the same actual variables are kept with the closure.   \n",
    "- If that variable’s value is later updated (from somewhere still having access), the closure will see the **updated value**, because they share the same reference.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relation to lifetime\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normally, `let` variables die when their block ends.  \n",
    "- With closures, if an inner function **still needs** those variables (and can still be called), **those variables remain alive in memory** as part of the closure’s lexical environment.   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where Closures Are Used\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture highlights several practical uses of closures in JavaScript:   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function factories**  \n",
    "  - Functions that generate and return other functions, each remembering its own private data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation / data hiding**  \n",
    "  - Keeping some data private inside a function, only accessible through inner functions that form closures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Callbacks**  \n",
    "  - Inner functions passed as callbacks often rely on variables from the outer function where they were created; closures allow these callbacks to access that data later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In all such patterns, closures allow functions to **remember context** even when executed in a different place or time.   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Closure**: A function plus its surrounding lexical environment (required data) that it can still access even after the outer function has executed.   \n",
    "- **Lexical scope / surrounding state**: The set of variables available in the environment where the function was defined, not where it is called.   \n",
    "- **Required data** (lecture’s informal term): The specific outer variables a function needs to work (for example, `name` in the inner function).   \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Main Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- A closure is created when a function **uses variables from an outer scope** and that function is **returned or passed out** so it can run later.   \n",
    "- Even after the outer function finishes, the inner function can still access its **required data** because JavaScript binds the function with **references** to those variables, preventing them from being destroyed.   \n",
    "- Closures are fundamental for **function factories, encapsulation, and callbacks**, and they rely on JavaScript’s **lexical scoping** rather than the call location.\n"
