    "# JavaScript Operators & Conditionals \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture explains **JavaScript operators** and how they work, along with key ideas needed to understand **conditional logic and control flow** in JavaScript.[1][2]\n",
    "It covers arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, ternary, and a brief introduction to bitwise operators, with emphasis on how they operate on values and affect program behaviour.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are **symbols that perform specific operations** (work) on values, known as **operands**.[1][3]\n",
    "For example, in \\(2 + 3\\), the numbers `2` and `3` are operands and `+` is an operator that performs addition and produces the result `5`.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operand**: The value on which an operator works (e.g., `2`, `3`).[1]\n",
    "- **Operator**: The symbol that defines the operation (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`).[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are grouped into several main categories in JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arithmetic operators  \n",
    "- Assignment operators  \n",
    "- Comparison operators  \n",
    "- Logical operators  \n",
    "- Conditional (ternary) operator  \n",
    "- Bitwise operators (briefly introduced)[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators perform **mathematical calculations** on numeric operands.[1][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- `+` (Addition): `2 + 3` → `5`.[3]\n",
    "- `-` (Subtraction): `5 - 3` → `2`.[3]\n",
    "- `*` (Multiplication): `5 * 2` → `10`.[3]\n",
    "- `/` (Division): `5 / 2` → `2.5`.[3]\n",
    "- `%` (Modulus / Remainder): `5 % 2` → remainder of `5 / 2`, i.e., `1`.[3]\n",
    "- `**` (Exponentiation): `2 ** 4` → \\(2^4 = 16\\).[1][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unary vs Binary Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary operator**: Requires **two operands**.  \n",
    "  - Example: `2 + 3` – `+` is binary.[1]\n",
    "- **Unary operator**: Works with **one operand**.  \n",
    "  - Example: `++a`, `a--` – `++` or `--` applied to a single variable.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increment and Decrement (Unary)\n",
    "\n",
    "These change a variable by **exactly 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `++a` / `a++` : increment by 1  \n",
    "- `--a` / `a--` : decrement by 1[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-increment (`++a`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two conceptual steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increment first**: Increase `a` by 1.  \n",
    "2. **Use the updated value** in the expression.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example idea:  \n",
    "If `a = 5`, then `console.log(++a)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: `a` becomes `6`.  \n",
    "- Step 2: prints `6`.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Post-increment (`a++`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two conceptual steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use the current value** in the expression.  \n",
    "2. **Increment afterwards**.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "If `a = 5`, then `console.log(a++)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: prints `5`.  \n",
    "- Step 2: `a` becomes `6` after printing.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The same pattern applies to **pre-decrement** (`--a`) and **post-decrement** (`a--`), but they decrease the value by 1.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment operators **store values** in variables.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- `=`: assigns a value to a variable.[3]\n",
    "  - Example: `let a = 5;` assigns `5` to `a`.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shorthand Assignment Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "These combine an operation and assignment in a concise way.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Shorthand | Expanded form        | Meaning                              |\n",
    "|----------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `a += 10` | `a = a + 10`        | Add 10 to `a`, then assign back.[3] |\n",
    "| `a -= 5`  | `a = a - 5`         | Subtract 5 from `a`.[3]             |\n",
    "| `a *= 3`  | `a = a * 3`         | Multiply `a` by 3.[3]              |\n",
    "| `a /= 2`  | `a = a / 2`         | Divide `a` by 2.[3]               |\n",
    "| `a %= 2`  | `a = a % 2`         | Store remainder of `a / 2`.[3]    |\n",
    "| `a **= b` | `a = a ** b`        | Raise `a` to power `b`.[3]        |\n",
    "\n",
    "These are only syntactic shortcuts; behaviour is identical to the long form.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators **compare two values** and always return a **boolean**: `true` or `false`.[1][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "- `>`  – greater than  \n",
    "- `<`  – less than  \n",
    "- `>=` – greater than or equal  \n",
    "- `<=` – less than or equal[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples (conceptually):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `10 > 5` → `true`  \n",
    "- `10 < 5` → `false`  \n",
    "- `5 >= 5` → `true`  \n",
    "- `5 <= 5` → `true`[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equality Operators: Loose vs Strict\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript has **two styles of equality**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Name               | Compares what?                       |\n",
    "|----------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `==`     | Loose equality     | Compares values **after type coercion**.[1][4] |\n",
    "| `===`    | Strict equality    | Compares **value and type**.[1][4] |\n",
    "| `!=`     | Loose inequality   | Negation of `==`.[1]             |\n",
    "| `!==`    | Strict inequality  | Negation of `===`.[1]            |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loose Equality (`==`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts operands to a common type, then compares values.[2][1]\n",
    "- Example idea: `\"5\" == 5` → `true` because both are treated as value `5` after coercion, even though one is a string and the other a number.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strict Equality (`===`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compares both **type** and **value**.  \n",
    "- Example idea: `\"5\" === 5` → `false` because one is string and one is number, types differ.[4][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Strict equality is generally preferred to avoid unexpected type coercion.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inequality Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- `!=` returns `true` if values are not equal under loose comparison.[1]\n",
    "- `!==` returns `true` if **value or type** differs under strict rules.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ternary (Conditional) Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ternary operator** is a compact form of an `if–else` decision and is the only operator that takes **three operands**.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `condition` is `true`, the expression evaluates to `valueIfTrue`.  \n",
    "- If `condition` is `false`, it evaluates to `valueIfFalse`.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an age-based voting rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Condition: `age > 18`  \n",
    "- If true: `\"I can vote\"`  \n",
    "- If false: `\"I cannot vote\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "let age = 25;\n",
    "let status = age > 18 ? \"I can vote\" : \"I cannot vote\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For `age = 25`, `status` becomes `\"I can vote\"`; for a younger age (e.g., `5`), it becomes `\"I cannot vote\"`.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The ternary operator is useful for **simple conditional assignments** where a full `if–else` block would be verbose.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators combine or invert boolean expressions and return a **boolean** or, with non-boolean operands, a **truthy/falsy value**.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "- `&&` – logical AND  \n",
    "- `||` – logical OR  \n",
    "- `!`  – logical NOT[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical AND (`&&`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "condition1 && condition2 && condition3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overall expression is `true` **only if all conditions are true**.[2][1]\n",
    "- If **any one** is `false`, result is `false`.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical OR (`||`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "condition1 || condition2 || condition3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overall expression is `true` if **at least one condition is true**.[2][1]\n",
    "- Only when **all conditions are false** is the result `false`.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical NOT (`!`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `!true` → `false`  \n",
    "- `!false` → `true`[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "`!` simply flips the boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Truthy, Falsy, and Non-Boolean Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators often work with **non-boolean values** in JavaScript, but internally they treat values as either **truthy** or **falsy**.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Falsy Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are considered **falsy**:[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- `undefined`  \n",
    "- `null`  \n",
    "- `0`  \n",
    "- `NaN`  \n",
    "- `\"\"` (empty string)  \n",
    "- `false` itself  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any other value is considered **truthy** (e.g., non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, objects).[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators with Non-Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules extend naturally:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For AND (`&&`):  \n",
    "  - Falsy AND anything → falsy overall.  \n",
    "  - All truthy → overall truthy.[1]\n",
    "- For OR (`||`):  \n",
    "  - Truthy OR anything → truthy overall.  \n",
    "  - All falsy → falsy overall.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `false || 7` → effectively “falsy OR truthy” → returns the **truthy** value (`7`).[1][2]  \n",
    "- `false && \"babbar\"` → “falsy AND truthy” → result is falsy, so the falsy value is used.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, logical operators often **return one of the operands**, not just `true` or `false`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `a || b` returns the first truthy value (or last value if all falsy).[1]  \n",
    "- `a && b` returns the first falsy value (or last value if all truthy).[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Short-Circuit Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators perform **short-circuiting**, meaning evaluation stops as soon as the result is determined.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### For `||` (OR)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the left operand is already truthy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The right side is **not evaluated** because the expression is guaranteed to be true.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "false || 7 || 11 || 18\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `false` is falsy → continue.  \n",
    "- `7` is truthy → result becomes `7`, and later values are not checked.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### For `&&` (AND)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the left operand is falsy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The right side is **not evaluated** because the expression cannot be true.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-circuiting is used to **avoid unnecessary checks** and to **provide default values** with `||` or guard conditions with `&&`.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bitwise Operators (Brief Mention)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitwise operators work on **binary (bit-level) representations** of numbers.[5][1]\n",
    "The lecture only briefly indicates that **bitwise operators** exist and are another category of JavaScript operators (like `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`), to be covered more fully later.[1][5]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operators** are symbols that perform specific operations on **operands**, and they are central to expressing logic in JavaScript.[2][1]\n",
    "- **Arithmetic operators** handle numeric calculations; **unary** forms like `++` and `--` require careful understanding of **pre** vs **post** behaviour.[3][1]\n",
    "- **Assignment operators** store values, and shorthand forms (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) make updates concise.[3]\n",
    "- **Comparison operators** always yield boolean results and include relational and equality checks; **strict equality (`===`)** is safer than loose equality (`==`) because it avoids automatic type coercion.[4][1]\n",
    "- The **ternary operator** provides a compact way to write simple `if–else` style expressions that choose between two values.[2][1]\n",
    "- **Logical operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`) support combining and inverting conditions, work with **truthy/falsy** concepts, and use **short-circuiting** to stop evaluation early, often returning one of the operands.[1][2]"
