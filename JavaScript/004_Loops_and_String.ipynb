    "# JavaScript Loops and Strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Loops\n",
    "Loops execute a block of code repeatedly for the same task, avoiding code duplication that makes programs bulky, buggy, and hard to maintain. Without loops, repeating \"console.log('Babbar')\" 24 times requires copying code, leading to maintenance issues if changes are needed everywhere. Loops solve this by repeating instructions efficiently until a condition fails.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- Reduces code repetition\n",
    "- Improves maintainability (change once, affects all iterations)\n",
    "- Handles repetitive tasks like printing sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loop\n",
    "**Syntax:** `for (initialization; condition; update) { // loop body }`[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:** Sets loop variable (e.g., `let i = 1`)\n",
    "- **Condition:** Runs while true (e.g., `i <= 10`); false exits loop\n",
    "- **Update:** Changes variable post-body (e.g., `i++`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Flow:**\n",
    "1. Initialize (e.g., i=1)\n",
    "2. Check condition (true? enter body)\n",
    "3. Execute body\n",
    "4. Update (i++)\n",
    "5. Repeat from step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\n",
    "  console.log('Babbar');\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Prints \"Babbar\" 10 times\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\n",
    "  console.log(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (let i = 5; i > 0; i--) {\n",
    "  console.log(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: 5 4 3 2 1 (reverse counting)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Break and Continue Keywords\n",
    "**Iteration:** One full cycle of loop body for a variable value (e.g., i=1 is first iteration).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Break:** Exits loop immediately upon reaching it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (let i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {\n",
    "  if (i === 4) break;\n",
    "  else console.log(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: 1 2 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Continue:** Skips rest of current iteration, jumps to next.\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {\n",
    "  if (i === 3) continue;\n",
    "  console.log(i);\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: 1 2 4 (skips 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## While Loop\n",
    "**Syntax:** Initialize outside, then `while (condition) { // body + update }`[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalent to for loop but separated:\n",
    "```\n",
    "let i = 1;\n",
    "while (i <= 10) {\n",
    "  console.log('Babbar');\n",
    "  i++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Same as for loop example\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use when initialization/update logic is complex or outside loop. Condition must eventually false to avoid infinite loops.[1][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Loops (Preview)\n",
    "- **Do-While:** Executes body at least once, checks condition after (`do { } while (condition);`).[4][5]\n",
    "- **For...in, For...of, ForEach:** Covered later with arrays/objects.[6]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strings Overview\n",
    "Strings (primitive type) have properties/methods for manipulation, discussed in-depth next. Access notes/documentation for full methods.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Master for/while loops for repetition: for suits known iterations, while for condition-driven. Use break to exit early, continue to skip. Practice counting/reverse examples to solidify flow—avoids infinite loops by ensuring condition fails. These fundamentals enable efficient, clean code for JS programs."
