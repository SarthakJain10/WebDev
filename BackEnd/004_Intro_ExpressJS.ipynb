    "# Introduction to Express.js\n",
    "\n",
    "Express.js serves as a lightweight web framework for Node.js, enabling production-level web application development. It addresses limitations of raw Node.js HTTP servers by simplifying routing, middleware handling, security implementation, and static file serving.[1][2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture demonstrates transitioning from basic Node.js servers to Express, emphasizing why Express is preferred for scalable applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Express.js?\n",
    "\n",
    "Node.js HTTP module creates basic servers but requires manual handling for common web tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations of plain Node.js HTTP:**\n",
    "  - No automatic server restart on code changes (solved by Nodemon: `npm install -g nodemon`).\n",
    "  - Cannot serve static files like CSS, images, or HTML directly.\n",
    "  - Manual implementation of security, routing (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), and request parsing.\n",
    "  - Leads to repetitive, hard-to-maintain code for production apps.[3][4][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Express provides utilities like built-in middleware, reducing boilerplate code while maintaining Node.js performance. It handles HTTP methods efficiently and supports dynamic routing.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Express version 4 (stable) for consistency: `npm i express@4`.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal \"Hello World\" App:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const express = require('express')\n",
    "const app = express()\n",
    "const port = 3000\n",
    "\n",
    "app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  res.send('Hello World!')\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "app.listen(port, () => {\n",
    "  console.log(`App listening on port ${port}`)\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run with `nodemon app.js` (or `node app.js`). Access `http://localhost:3000` to see output. Changes auto-reload via Nodemon.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- `express()` creates the app instance.\n",
    "- `app.get(path, handler)` defines routes; handler receives `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects.\n",
    "- `res.send()` sends response data.[5][1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP Methods and Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Browsers default to **GET requests**; POST requires forms or tools like Postman.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Routes:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app.get('/about', (req, res) => res.send('About Us'))\n",
    "app.get('/contact', (req, res) => res.send('Hello Contact Me'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Unmatched paths return 404 Not Found.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Routing with Parameters:**\n",
    "Use `:paramName` for URL variables (e.g., `/blog/:slug`).\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app.get('/blog/:slug', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  const slug = req.params.slug  // Access via req.params object\n",
    "  res.send(`Hello ${slug}!`)    // e.g., /blog/intro-js → \"Hello intro-js!\"\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "Multiple params: `/user/:id/:action`. Log full object: `console.log(req.params)`.[6][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Parameters:**\n",
    "Data after `?` (e.g., `/search?query=js&mode=dark`).\n",
    "Access: `req.query.query` or `req.query.mode`.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app.get('/search', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  console.log(req.query)  // { query: 'js', mode: 'dark' }\n",
    "  res.send(`Query: ${req.query.query}`)\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Difference:** Params (`:slug`) are path segments; queries are optional key-value pairs after `?`.[7][5][6][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Serving Static Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Use built-in middleware: `app.use(express.static('public'))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Place files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) in `public/` folder.\n",
    "- Access: `http://localhost:3000/style.css` serves directly.\n",
    "- Multiple directories: `app.use(express.static('public')); app.use(express.static('files'))`.\n",
    "- Avoid exposing source code (e.g., don't put `index.js` in public).[8][9][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Note:** Raw Node.js exposes backend code if mishandled; Express prevents this via proper static middleware.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Express.js streamlines Node.js web development with easy routing (`app.get`), parameters (`req.params`), queries (`req.query`), and static serving (`express.static`). Start with version 4, use Nodemon for development, and refer to official docs for middleware details. Practice building routes for blogs or apps to master dynamic handling."
