    "# MongoDB Installation and Basics \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to MongoDB\n",
    "MongoDB is a **document-based NoSQL database** that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents rather than rigid tables, making it ideal for modern web applications. Its syntax resembles JavaScript, simplifying development for JavaScript developers. Unlike relational databases like MySQL, MongoDB avoids predefined schemas, allowing documents with varying structures within the same collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key advantages include scalability for unstructured data and ease of use with JavaScript objects. Data persists across sessions, unlike temporary browser tabs. The lecture demonstrates installation on Windows, basic usage via GUI and shell, and VS Code integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation on Windows\n",
    "Download the **MongoDB Community Edition** (.msi package) from the official website, selecting the 64-bit version for your platform. Run the installer with these settings:\n",
    "- Accept terms and choose **Complete** installation.\n",
    "- Install **MongoDB as a Windows Service** (runs automatically as \"MongoDB Service\").\n",
    "- Install **MongoDB Compass** (GUI tool) during setup.\n",
    "- Grant necessary permissions when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, verify by checking Task Manager for `mongod.exe` process or running `mongod --version` in Command Prompt. Default port is **27017**. Compass installs automatically for visual management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:** Add MongoDB's `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\8.0\\bin`) to system PATH for easy command access.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB vs Relational Databases\n",
    "**Relational databases** (e.g., MySQL) use tables with rows/columns and fixed schemas, enforcing relationships via foreign keys—efficient for structured data but complex for evolving schemas. **MongoDB** uses a document model:\n",
    "- **Database**: Container for collections (like a drive with folders).\n",
    "- **Collection**: Group of documents (like a folder; schema-less).\n",
    "- **Document**: JSON/BSON object with key-value pairs (like a file; can nest fields/arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect              | Relational (MySQL)          | MongoDB (NoSQL)             |\n",
    "|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n",
    "| Data Structure     | Tables, rows, columns      | Collections, documents     |\n",
    "| Schema             | Fixed/predefined           | Dynamic/schema-less        |\n",
    "| Relationships      | Foreign keys               | Embedded/referenced docs   |\n",
    "| Scalability        | Vertical (bigger server)   | Horizontal (more servers)  |\n",
    "| Query Language     | SQL                        | JavaScript-like            | \n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB suits rapid development; relational fits transactions with strict consistency.[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using MongoDB Compass (GUI)\n",
    "Launch **Compass** and connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017`. Features:\n",
    "- Create databases (e.g., \"sigma\") and collections (e.g., \"courses\").\n",
    "- Insert documents: Click **Add Data** → JSON mode, e.g., `{ \"name\": \"Java\", \"price\": 0, \"instructor\": \"Harry\" }`.\n",
    "- View/edit documents in real-time; export as CSV/JSON.\n",
    "- Refresh to see persisted data after restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example document insertion persists across disconnects/shutdowns, unlike non-persistent session data.[8][9][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB Shell and VS Code Extension\n",
    "**MongoDB Shell (mongosh)**: Access via Compass or terminal.\n",
    "- `show dbs`: List databases.\n",
    "- `use sigma`: Switch to database.\n",
    "- `db.courses.insertOne({ \"name\": \"JavaScript\" })`: Insert document.\n",
    "- `db.courses.find()`: Query documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VS Code Extension** (\"MongoDB for VS Code\"): Official tool for seamless integration.\n",
    "- Add connection (localhost:27017).\n",
    "- Explore databases/collections; view/edit schemas.\n",
    "- **Playgrounds**: Run scripts like `use('sigma'); db.courses.insertMany([...])` for prototyping.\n",
    "- Generate bulk data via ChatGPT, paste as JSON array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports real-time edits and scripting without leaving your IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hands-on Examples\n",
    "1. **Create & Insert**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   db.courses.insertOne({\n",
    "     name: \"Java\",\n",
    "     price: 0,\n",
    "     instructor: \"Harry\"\n",
    "   })\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Query**: `db.courses.find()` shows all; edits sync across tools.\n",
    "3. **Bulk Insert**: Use arrays from AI tools for realistic data (e.g., multiple courses).\n",
    "4. **Persistence Test**: Insert → disconnect → reconnect → data remains.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Common pitfall: Typos create unintended collections (e.g., \"course\" vs \"courses\").[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "This lecture covers MongoDB installation (Community Edition + Compass), core concepts (document model vs relational), and tools (Compass, shell, VS Code extension). Key takeaways: MongoDB's flexibility speeds web dev; start locally on localhost:27017, persist data in schema-less collections, and prototype via playgrounds. Practice inserting/querying courses database for mastery—ideal for your Streamlit/web projects."
