    "# Web Hosting Fundamentals: What, Where, and How to Host\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Hosting\n",
    "Web hosting provides access to remote servers (computers) maintained by providers to run websites or apps 24/7, unlike local laptops that can't be shared easily. Providers like \"Vikram Uncle\" offer rented server space in data centers worldwide, giving you an IP address, username (often **root** for admin access), and password via **SSH** (Secure Shell) for remote control. This setup allows friends worldwide to access your app by simply visiting the IP, eliminating the need to share your physical machine.[1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Key analogy: Rent a cloud computer ($5/month entry-level) instead of keeping your laptop always on; choose regions (e.g., Chicago for US users) to reduce latency.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Web Hosting\n",
    "Hosting comes in three primary categories, each balancing cost, control, and performance for different needs like static sites, Node.js apps, or WordPress blogs.[3][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n",
    "|------|-------------|------|------|----------|\n",
    "| **Shared Hosting** | Multiple users share one server's resources (like roommates splitting a house). | Cheap ($1-5/month); easy setup. | Slower due to shared CPU/RAM; less control. | Beginners, small static sites. [2][5] |\n",
    "| **Dedicated/VPS Hosting** | Full or virtual dedicated server (VPS slices a physical server); root access for custom installs. | High performance; scalable; full control (e.g., install Node.js, MongoDB). | More expensive ($5-50+/month); requires Linux commands. | Apps, dynamic sites (e.g., Express.js). [4][3] |\n",
    "| **Managed Hosting** | Provider pre-installs software (e.g., WordPress dashboard); no SSH needed. | User-friendly; auto-updates. | Costlier; limited customization. | Non-coders, WordPress/Elementor users. [6][1] |\n",
    "\n",
    "**VPS** (Virtual Private Server) is highlighted as ideal for developers—get dedicated resources on a shared physical machine.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Hosting Works: Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "1. **Purchase Hosting**: Compare providers (Hostinger, DigitalOcean, AWS) for deals/coupons; check 30-day money-back guarantees. Students in India: Look at ZNETLIVE (₹49/month, 40GB space) or Hostinger for budget plans.[7][8][1]\n",
    "2. **Get Credentials**: Receive IP (e.g., 88.722.11), root username, password.\n",
    "3. **Connect via SSH**:\n",
    "   - Terminal command: `ssh root@your-ip` (port 22), enter password.\n",
    "   - Windows: Use PuTTY; Linux/macOS: Built-in terminal.\n",
    "   - Gain full server control (e.g., `ls` lists files, `cd` navigates).[9][10][1]\n",
    "4. **Transfer Files**: Use **FileZilla** (free client):\n",
    "   - Enter host (IP), username (root), password, port 22 (SFTP for security).\n",
    "   - Drag-and-drop files (e.g., Node.js app folder); avoid uploading `node_modules`.[11][12][1]\n",
    "5. **Deploy App**: On server, run `npm install`, then use **PM2** (`npm i -g pm2; pm2 start app.js`) for auto-restarts and monitoring.[13][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Linux Commands**: `mkdir` (make directory), `cd` (change directory), `pwd` (present working directory).[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Deployment Example: Node.js App\n",
    "- Create structured folder: `/home/app/src` (controllers, models, routes, views).\n",
    "- Upload via FileZilla to `/home/npm-app`.\n",
    "- SSH in: `cd /home/npm-app`, `npm init -y`, `npm i express`, add `.env` for secrets (load with `dotenv`).\n",
    "- Run with PM2 for production: Keeps app alive 24/7.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**: Compare 2-3 providers; use promo codes; test with trials. Avoid unknown companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Hosting rents optimized, always-on servers for global access—start with VPS for dev projects like Streamlit/Node.js apps.\n",
    "- Master SSH/FileZilla for control; choose shared for simple sites, VPS/managed for apps.\n",
    "- Providers: Hostinger/DigitalOcean for students; focus on uptime (99.9%), regions, and refunds.\n",
    "- Next: Deploy databases, scale with PM2—essential for portfolios/hackathons."
