    "# Express.js Middleware\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Middleware\n",
    "Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that process HTTP requests before they reach route handlers. They have access to the **request object (req)**, **response object (res)**, and the **next function** to pass control to the next middleware or route handler. Middleware sits between incoming requests and final responses, enabling tasks like logging, authentication, and data modification during the request-response cycle.[1][2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Key capabilities include:\n",
    "- Executing arbitrary code.\n",
    "- Modifying req and res objects.\n",
    "- Ending the request-response cycle with res.send().\n",
    "- Calling next() to proceed to the next middleware.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Without calling next(), requests hang indefinitely, causing browser timeouts.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts and Request Flow\n",
    "In Express, requests flow through a stack of middleware functions in the order they are defined. A basic request cycle matches routes like app.get('/', ...) after middleware processes the req.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Request-Response Cycle Visualization**:\n",
    "- Request arrives → Middleware 1 (modifies req, calls next()) → Middleware 2 → Route handler → Response sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**next() Function**: Essential callback that hands control to the subsequent middleware or handler. Omitting it stalls the request.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Order matters: Earlier middleware changes propagate downstream, overwriting prior modifications (e.g., req.harry = '56' in first middleware, overridden in second).[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing and Using Middleware\n",
    "Create middleware as functions with signature `(req, res, next)`. Load via app.use() for application-wide execution.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax**:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "app.use((req, res, next) => {\n",
    "  console.log('Middleware executed');\n",
    "  next();  // Proceed\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- **Logging Middleware**: Adds timestamp and method.\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  app.use((req, res, next) => {\n",
    "    console.log(`${Date.now()} - ${req.method} ${req.url}`);\n",
    "    fs.appendFileSync('logs.txt', `GET request at ${Date.now()}\\n`);\n",
    "    next();\n",
    "  });\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Modifying Request**: Attach custom properties.\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  app.use((req, res, next) => {\n",
    "    req.harry = 56;\n",
    "    console.log(req.headers);\n",
    "    next();\n",
    "  });\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Access in routes: res.send(`Hello ${req.harry}`).[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ending Response Early**: Use res.send() instead of next() to terminate (e.g., \"Hacked by middleware!\"). Calling next() after res.send() causes \"Cannot set headers after they are sent\" errors.[2][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mount Paths**: Limit scope, e.g., app.use('/user/:id', middleware) executes only for matching paths.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Middleware\n",
    "Express supports five middleware types, each with specific use cases.[6][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "|------|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Application-level** | Applies to entire app via app.use(). Ideal for global tasks like logging. | `app.use(express.json())` parses JSON bodies [7]. |\n",
    "| **Router-level** | Bound to express.Router() instances for route groups. | `router.use((req, res, next) => { ... }); app.use('/blog', router);` [2]. |\n",
    "| **Error-handling** | Signature `(err, req, res, next)`. Catches errors globally. | `app.use((err, req, res, next) => { res.status(500).send('Error!'); });` [2]. |\n",
    "| **Built-in** | Native Express functions like express.static (serves files), express.json(), express.urlencoded() [7][1]. | `app.use(express.static('public'));` serves harry.txt.gz. |\n",
    "| **Third-party** | NPM packages like cookie-parser. | `npm i cookie-parser; app.use(cookieParser());` [2]. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-stacks**: Chain multiple via app.use(fn1, fn2) or arrays [logStuff] for reusable groups.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Route Skipping**: Use next('route') to bypass remaining middleware in a stack.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications and Best Practices\n",
    "- **Logging**: Track timestamps, methods, URLs; write to files for analysis.[1]\n",
    "- **Authentication**: Check req.headers['x-auth'] before routes; return 401 if invalid.[2]\n",
    "- **Static Files**: app.use(express.static('public')) serves assets efficiently.[1]\n",
    "- **Order Sensitivity**: Define logging before parsing, authentication before sensitive routes.[5]\n",
    "- **Async Middleware**: Express 5+ handles Promise rejections by calling next(err) automatically.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Pitfalls:\n",
    "- Forgetting next() → Hanging requests.\n",
    "- res.send() + next() → Header errors.\n",
    "- Incorrect error middleware signature → Fails silently.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Express middleware powers request processing through a flexible stack system, enabling logging, modification, and control flow. Master application/router-level types, always call next(), and leverage built-in/third-party options for robust apps. Practice by building loggers and auth checkers to solidify understanding."
