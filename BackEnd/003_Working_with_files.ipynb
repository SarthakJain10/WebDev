    "# Node.js FS and Path Modules: File System Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The lecture covers Node.js built-in modules for file handling: **fs** (File System) for reading, writing, and appending files, and **path** for managing file paths cross-platform. These modules enable server-side JavaScript to interact with the operating system's file system without external dependencies. Key focus areas include synchronous vs. asynchronous operations, avoiding **callback hell**, and using **Promises** for cleaner code.[1][2][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "## FS Module Basics\n",
    "The **fs** module provides APIs modeled after POSIX standards for file operations. Import it using `const fs = require('fs');` or ES modules with `import fs from 'fs';`. It offers synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) methods, with async preferred for Node.js's event-driven nature.[2][4]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous Methods** (e.g., `fs.writeFileSync('file.txt', 'content')`): Block the main thread until complete, suitable for simple scripts but risky for performance.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous Methods** (callback-based): Use callbacks like `fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'content', (err, data) => { ... })` for non-blocking I/O.\n",
    "- Common error handling: Callbacks receive `err` first; check `if (err) console.error(err);`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Writing \"Harry is a good boy\" to `harry.txt` prints \"starting\", schedules write, prints \"ending\", then \"done\" on completion.[3][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Callback Hell and Append Operations\n",
    "Nested callbacks for sequential operations (write → read → write) create **callback hell**—deeply indented, hard-to-maintain code. The lecture demonstrates this with repeated file reads/writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **appendFile**: Adds content without overwriting. Syntax: `fs.appendFile('file.txt', 'new content', callback)`.\n",
    "  - Example: Appending \"Harry robo\" to existing file shows original + new content.\n",
    "- **readFile**: Reads content as Buffer; convert with `.toString()` for text: `fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => console.log(data.toString()));`.[5][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid sync methods in production as they halt execution; async keeps the event loop responsive.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "## FS Promises: Modern Alternative\n",
    "**fs.promises** eliminates callbacks using Promise-based APIs. Import as `import { promises as fs } from 'fs';` or `const fs = require('fs').promises;`. Use `await` in async functions or `.then()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Methods**:\n",
    "- `await fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8')`: Returns string directly.\n",
    "- `await fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'new content')`: Overwrites file.\n",
    "- `await fs.appendFile('file.txt', 'append this')`: Adds to end; runs repeatedly without overwriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example** (chained operations):\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const content = await fs.readFile('read.txt', 'utf8');\n",
    "await fs.writeFile('read.txt', 'This is amazing promise\\n' + content);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Reads, modifies, and writes back cleanly—no nesting.[6][7][8]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Path Module Utilities\n",
    "**path** module handles path strings portably across OS (handles `/` vs `\\`). Import: `const path = require('path');`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Essential Functions**:\n",
    "- `path.extname('file.txt')`: Returns `.txt`.\n",
    "- `path.dirname('/path/to/file.txt')`: Returns `/path/to`.\n",
    "- `path.basename('file.txt')`: Returns `file.txt`.\n",
    "- `path.join('C:\\\\', 'programs', 'read.txt')`: Outputs OS-correct path like `C:\\programs\\read.txt` (normalizes slashes).[9][10][11]\n",
    "\n",
    "Use for safe path construction; avoids manual string concatenation errors like escape sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices and Documentation\n",
    "- Prefer **Promises/async-await** over callbacks for readability.\n",
    "- Always handle errors with try-catch for Promises.\n",
    "- Read official docs (nodejs.org/api/fs.html) for full API, but prioritize hands-on practice over exhaustive reading—docs suit advanced users.[11][2]\n",
    "- For beginners: Build projects using core methods; avoid over-relying on sync or third-party libs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Master **fs** for file I/O (write/read/append via callbacks or Promises) and **path** for robust paths to build file-handling apps. Shift from callback hell to Promises for scalable code; practice with real files to solidify concepts."
